Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

1. The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter or a space.
2. All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (`,`,`;`,`:`) or terminal marks (`.`,`?`,`!`,`‽`).
3. There must be a single space between each word.
4. The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.

This problem was asked by Atlassian.

MegaCorp wants to give bonuses to its employees based on how many lines of codes they have written. They would like to give the smallest positive amount to each worker consistent with the constraint that if a developer has written more lines of code than their neighbor, they should receive more money.

Given an array representing a line of seats of employees at MegaCorp, determine how much each one should get paid.

For example, given `[10, 40, 200, 1000, 60, 30]`, you should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1547 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding `next` and `prev` fields, it holds a field named `both`, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an `add(element)` which adds the element to the end, and a `get(index)` which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to `get_pointer` and `dereference_pointer` functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1545 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Uber.

You have `N` stones in a row, and would like to create from them a pyramid. This pyramid should be constructed such that the height of each stone increases by one until reaching the tallest stone, after which the heights decrease by one. In addition, the start and end stones of the pyramid should each be one stone high.

You can change the height of any stone by paying a cost of `1` unit to lower its height by `1`, as many times as necessary. Given this information, determine the lowest cost method to produce this pyramid.

For example, given the stones `[1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1]`, the optimal solution is to pay `2` to create `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1544 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains an empty sub-directory `subdir1` and a sub-directory `subdir2` containing a file `file.ext`.

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains two sub-directories `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and an empty second-level sub-directory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a second-level sub-directory `subsubdir2` containing a file `file2.ext`.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`, and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:

The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.

The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1533 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Samsung.

A group of houses is connected to the main water plant by means of a set of pipes. A house can either be connected by a set of pipes extending directly to the plant, or indirectly by a pipe to a nearby house which is otherwise connected.

For example, here is a possible configuration, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are houses, and arrows represent pipes:

```
A <--> B <--> C <--> plant
```

Each pipe has an associated cost, which the utility company would like to minimize. Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water.

In the following setup, for example, we can remove all but the pipes from `plant` to `A`, `plant` to `B`, and `B` to `C`, for a total cost of `16`.

```
pipes = {
    'plant': {'A': 1, 'B': 5, 'C': 20},
    'A': {'C': 15},

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1529 [Medium]

This question was asked by BufferBox.

Given a binary tree where all nodes are either `0` or `1`, prune the tree so that subtrees containing all `0`s are removed.

For example, given the following tree:

```
   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 0   0
```

should be pruned to:

```
   0
  / \
 1   0
    /
   1
```

We do not remove the tree at the root or its left child because it still has a `1` as a descendant.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1527 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Apple.

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the `i`-th row and `j`-th column is `(i + 1) * (j + 1)` (if 0-indexed) or `i * j` (if 1-indexed).

Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the multiplication table looks like this:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |

| 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |

| 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |

And there are 4 12's in the table.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are `N` sites, and each site `i` has a certain count `C``i` of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site `S``j` is defined as :

```
score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))
```

Here, `S``x`, `S``y`, `...`, `S``z` denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to `S``j`, and `d` is a damping factor, usually set to around `0.85`, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1525 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, €, corresponds to the three bytes `11100010 10000010 10101100`. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

- For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
- For an `n`-byte character, the first byte starts with `n` ones and a zero. The other `n - 1` bytes all start with `10`.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1518 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as `0101` or `111110`, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a `0` in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to `1`.

Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):

```
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s
```

With this encoding, `cats` would be represented as `0000110111`.

Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.
