## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1526 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are `N` sites, and each site `i` has a certain count `C``i` of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site `S``j` is defined as :

```
score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))
```

Here, `S``x`, `S``y`, `...`, `S``z` denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to `S``j`, and `d` is a damping factor, usually set to around `0.85`, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.

This problem was asked by Google.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, €, corresponds to the three bytes `11100010 10000010 10101100`. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

- For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
- For an `n`-byte character, the first byte starts with `n` ones and a zero. The other `n - 1` bytes all start with `10`.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1524 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input `[3, 4, -1, 1]` should give `2`. The input `[1, 2, 0]` should give `3`.

You can modify the input array in-place.

Given the root to a binary search tree, find the second largest node in the tree.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1522 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a string `s` and a list of words `words`, where each word is the same length, find all starting indices of substrings in `s` that is a concatenation of every word in `words` exactly once.

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], return [0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in `s`.

The order of the indices does not matter.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1520 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers where every integer occurs three times except for one integer, which only occurs once, find and return the non-duplicated integer.

For example, given [6, 1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6], return 1. Given [13, 19, 13, 13], return 19.

Do this in O(N) time and O(1) space.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1519 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1518 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as `0101` or `111110`, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a `0` in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to `1`.

Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):

```
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s
```

With this encoding, `cats` would be represented as `0000110111`.

Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.

A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving the graph connected. For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.

Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
