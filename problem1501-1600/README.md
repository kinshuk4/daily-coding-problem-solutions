## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1504 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.

That is, given a string of length `N` and a pattern of length `k`, write a program that searches for the pattern in the string with less than `O(N * k)` worst-case time complexity.

If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return `False`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1503 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set `{1, 2, 3}`, it should return `{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}`.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1502 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there is not greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.

For example, the list `[1,2,3]` should return `[1,3,2]`. The list `[1,3,2]` should return `[2,1,3]`. The list `[3,2,1]` should return `[1,2,3]`.

Can you perform the operation without allocating extra memory (disregarding the input memory)?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1501 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Apple.

Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all values under a node, including the node itself.

For example, given the following tree:

```
  5
 / \
2  -5
```

Return `2` as it occurs twice: once as the left leaf, and once as the sum of `2 + 5 - 5`.
