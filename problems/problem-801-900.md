# Daily Coding Problems 801 - 900

## Problem 801 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Zillow.

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of `7`, or the sum of unique powers of `7`. The first few sevenish numbers are `1`, `7`, `8`, `49`, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the `n`th sevenish number.

## Problem 802 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Triplebyte.

You are given `n` numbers as well as `n` probabilities that sum up to 1. Write a function to generate one of the numbers with its corresponding probability.

For example, given the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and probabilities `[0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2]`, your function should return `1` 10% of the time, `2` 50% of the time, and 3 and 4 20% of the time.

You can generate random numbers between 0 and 1 uniformly.

## Problem 803 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number with all distinct digits.

Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the secret code. For example, if the secret code were `123456`, then a guess of `175286` would score two, since `1` and `6` were correctly placed.

Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores, determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.

For example, for the following scores you should return `True`, since they correspond to the secret code `123456`:

```
{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}
```

However, it is impossible for any key to result in the following scores, so in this case you should return `False`:

```
{123456: 4, 345678: 4, 567890: 4}
```

## Problem 804 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

You are given a huge list of airline ticket prices between different cities around the world on a given day. These are all direct flights. Each element in the list has the format `(source_city, destination, price)`.

Consider a user who is willing to take up to `k` connections from their origin city `A` to their destination `B`. Find the cheapest fare possible for this journey and print the itinerary for that journey.

For example, our traveler wants to go from `JFK` to `LAX` with up to `3` connections, and our input flights are as follows:

```
[
    ('JFK', 'ATL', 150),
    ('ATL', 'SFO', 400),
    ('ORD', 'LAX', 200),
    ('LAX', 'DFW', 80),
    ('JFK', 'HKG', 800),
    ('ATL', 'ORD', 90),
    ('JFK', 'LAX', 500),
]
```

Due to some improbably low flight prices, the cheapest itinerary would be `JFK -> ATL -> ORD -> LAX`, costing $440.

## Problem 805 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Spreadsheets often use this alphabetical encoding for its columns: "A", "B", "C", ..., "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ", "AAA", "AAB", ....

Given a column number, return its alphabetical column id. For example, given `1`, return "A". Given `27`, return "AA".

## Problem 806 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Let A be an N by M matrix in which every row and every column is sorted.

Given i1, j1, i2, and j2, compute the number of elements of M smaller than M[i1, j1] and larger than M[i2, j2].

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 20],
 [2, 6, 9, 14, 22, 25],
 [3, 8, 10, 15, 25, 30],
 [10, 11, 12, 23, 30, 35],
 [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]]
```

And i1 = 1, j1 = 1, i2 = 3, j2 = 3, return 15 as there are 15 numbers in the matrix smaller than 6 or greater than 23.

## Problem 807 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb".

## Problem 808 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has `O(h)` space complexity, where `h` is the height of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using `O(1)` space.

## Problem 809 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

## Problem 810 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Morgan Stanley.

In Ancient Greece, it was common to write text with the first line going left to right, the second line going right to left, and continuing to go back and forth. This style was called "boustrophedon".

Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to print the nodes in boustrophedon order.

For example, given the following tree:

```
       1
    /     \
  2         3
 / \       / \
4   5     6   7
```

You should return `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

## Problem 811 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Square.

Given a list of words, return the shortest unique prefix of each word. For example, given the list:

- dog
- cat
- apple
- apricot
- fish

Return the list:

- d
- c
- app
- apr
- f

## Problem 812 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on game results.

A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a 2000-ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player.

Implement this system.

## Problem 813 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.

Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

## Problem 814 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

For example, given

```
9 -> 9
5 -> 2
```

return 124 (99 + 25) as:

```
4 -> 2 -> 1
```

## Problem 815 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 = r^2.

## Problem 816 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given three 32-bit integers x, y, and b, return x if b is 1 and y if b is 0, using only mathematical or bit operations. You can assume b can only be 1 or 0.

## Problem 817 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list. If there is more than one possible reconstruction, return any of them. If there is no possible reconstruction, then return null.

For example, given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string "thequickbrownfox", you should return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'].

Given the set of words 'bed', 'bath', 'bedbath', 'and', 'beyond', and the string "bedbathandbeyond", return either ['bed', 'bath', 'and', 'beyond] or ['bedbath', 'and', 'beyond'].

## Problem 818 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Square.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than `N`. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.

For example, to find all primes less than `100`, we would first mark `[4, 6, 8, ...]` (multiples of two), then `[6, 9, 12, ...]` (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than `N`, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.

Implement this algorithm.

Bonus: Create a generator that produces primes indefinitely (that is, without taking `N` as an input).

## Problem 819 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

## Problem 820 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input `[3, 4, -1, 1]` should give `2`. The input `[1, 2, 0]` should give `3`.

You can modify the input array in-place.

## Problem 821 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Apple.

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return `False`.

For example, given `[-6, 0, 2, 40]`, you should return `2`. Given `[1, 5, 7, 8]`, you should return `False`.

## Problem 822 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Snapchat.

Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].

## Problem 823 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a bit array.

A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of `1` or `0` at each index.

- `init(size)`: initialize the array with `size`
- `set(i, val)`: updates index at `i` with `val` where `val` is either `1` or `0`.
- `get(i)`: gets the value at index `i`.

## Problem 824 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Salesforce.

Write a program to merge two binary trees. Each node in the new tree should hold a value equal to the sum of the values of the corresponding nodes of the input trees.

If only one input tree has a node in a given position, the corresponding node in the new tree should match that input node.

## Problem 825 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

For example, given [-9, -2, 0, 2, 3], return [0, 4, 4, 9, 81].

## Problem 826 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement a file syncing algorithm for two computers over a low-bandwidth network. What if we know the files in the two computers are mostly the same?

## Problem 827 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You are the technical director of WSPT radio, serving listeners nationwide. For simplicity's sake we can consider each listener to live along a horizontal line stretching from `0` (west) to `1000` (east).

Given a list of `N` listeners, and a list of `M` radio towers, each placed at various locations along this line, determine what the minimum broadcast range would have to be in order for each listener's home to be covered.

For example, suppose `listeners = [1, 5, 11, 20]`, and `towers = [4, 8, 15]`. In this case the minimum range would be `5`, since that would be required for the tower at position `15` to reach the listener at position `20`.

## Problem 828 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Write a program to determine how many distinct ways there are to create a max heap from a list of `N` given integers.

For example, if `N = 3`, and our integers are `[1, 2, 3]`, there are two ways, shown below.

```
  3      3
 / \    / \
1   2  2   1
```

## Problem 829 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Create a data structure that performs all the following operations in `O(1)` time:

- `plus`: Add a key with value `1`. If the key already exists, increment its value by one.
- `minus`: Decrement the value of a key. If the key's value is currently `1`, remove it.
- `get_max`: Return a key with the highest value.
- `get_min`: Return a key with the lowest value.

## Problem 830 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

Given a list of numbers, create an algorithm that arranges them in order to form the largest possible integer. For example, given `[10, 7, 76, 415]`, you should return `77641510`.

## Problem 831 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a string `s` and a list of words `words`, where each word is the same length, find all starting indices of substrings in `s` that is a concatenation of every word in `words` exactly once.

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], return [0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in `s`.

The order of the indices does not matter.

## Problem 832 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of elements, return the length of the longest subarray where all its elements are distinct.

For example, given the array `[5, 1, 3, 5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, return 5 as the longest subarray of distinct elements is `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

## Problem 833 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Pinterest.

At a party, there is a single person who everyone knows, but who does not know anyone in return (the "celebrity"). To help figure out who this is, you have access to an `O(1)` method called `knows(a, b)`, which returns `True` if person `a` knows person `b`, else `False`.

Given a list of `N` people and the above operation, find a way to identify the celebrity in `O(N)` time.

## Problem 834 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

There are `N` couples sitting in a row of length `2 * N`. They are currently ordered randomly, but would like to rearrange themselves so that each couple's partners can sit side by side.

What is the minimum number of swaps necessary for this to happen?

## Problem 835 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Square.

Given a string and a set of characters, return the shortest substring containing all the characters in the set.

For example, given the string "figehaeci" and the set of characters {a, e, i}, you should return "aeci".

If there is no substring containing all the characters in the set, return null.

## Problem 836 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.

It should run in O(N) time.

Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.

## Problem 837 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Nest.

Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

1. The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter or a space.
2. All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (`,`,`;`,`:`) or terminal marks (`.`,`?`,`!`,`‽`).
3. There must be a single space between each word.
4. The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.

## Problem 838 [Medium]

This question was asked by Zillow.

You are given a 2-d `matrix` where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. Assuming we start at `matrix[0][0]`, and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

For example, in this matrix

```
0 3 1 1
2 0 0 4
1 5 3 1
```

The most we can collect is 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins.

## Problem 839 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words. Find the maximum number of words that can be packed on the board from the given dictionary.

A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:

- It can be found in the dictionary
- It can be constructed from untaken letters by other words found so far on the board
- The letters are adjacent to each other (vertically and horizontally, not diagonally).

Each tile can be visited only once by any word.

For example, given the following dictionary:

```
{ 'eat', 'rain', 'in', 'rat' }
```

and matrix:

```
[['e', 'a', 'n'],
 ['t', 't', 'i'],
 ['a', 'r', 'a']]
```

Your function should return 3, since we can make the words 'eat', 'in', and 'rat' without them touching each other. We could have alternatively made 'eat' and 'rain', but that would be incorrect since that's only 2 words.

## Problem 840 [Medium]

This problem was asked by PayPal.

Given a string and a number of lines `k`, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the `k``th` line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence `"thisisazigzag"` and `k = 4`, you should print:

```
t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g
```

## Problem 841 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Given integers `M` and `N`, write a program that counts how many positive integer pairs `(a, b)` satisfy the following conditions:

- `a + b = M`
- `a XOR b = N`

## Problem 842 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Invert a binary tree.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 / \  /
d   e f
```

should become:

```
  a
 / \
 c  b
 \  / \
  f e  d
```

## Problem 843 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given a string and a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurrences of the pattern in the string. For example, given the string "abracadabra" and the pattern "abr", you should return `[0, 7]`.

## Problem 844 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

A Boolean formula can be said to be satisfiable if there is a way to assign truth values to each variable such that the entire formula evaluates to true.

For example, suppose we have the following formula, where the symbol `¬` is used to denote negation:

```
(¬c OR b) AND (b OR c) AND (¬b OR c) AND (¬c OR ¬a)
```

One way to satisfy this formula would be to let `a = False`, `b = True`, and `c = True`.

This type of formula, with `AND` statements joining tuples containing exactly one `OR`, is known as `2-CNF`.

Given a `2-CNF` formula, find a way to assign truth values to satisfy it, or return `False` if this is impossible.

## Problem 845 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` rotated by two becomes `[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]`. Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?

## Problem 846 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

`cons(a, b)` constructs a pair, and `car(pair)` and `cdr(pair)` returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, `car(cons(3, 4))` returns `3`, and `cdr(cons(3, 4))` returns `4`.

Given this implementation of cons:

```
def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair
```

Implement `car` and `cdr`.

## Problem 847 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Pinterest.

Given an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.

For example, `[2, 0, 1, 0]` returns `True` while `[1, 1, 0, 1]` returns `False`.

## Problem 848 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value)`: sets `key` to `value`. If there are already `n` items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.
- `get(key)`: gets the value at `key`. If no such key exists, return null.

Each operation should run in O(1) time.

## Problem 849 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Apple.

A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer:

- if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2
- if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1

It is conjectured that every such sequence eventually reaches the number `1`. Test this conjecture.

Bonus: What input `n <= 1000000` gives the longest sequence?

## Problem 850 [Hard]

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

Given a set of characters `C` and an integer `k`, a De Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible `k`-length string of characters in `C` occurs exactly once.

For example, suppose `C = {0, 1}` and `k = 3`. Then our sequence should contain the substrings `{'000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111'}`, and one possible solution would be `00010111`.

Create an algorithm that finds a De Bruijn sequence.

## Problem 851 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving the graph connected. For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.

Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.

## Problem 852 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a circular array, compute its maximum subarray sum in O(n) time. A subarray can be empty, and in this case the sum is 0.

For example, given `[8, -1, 3, 4]`, return `15` as we choose the numbers `3`, `4`, and `8` where the `8` is obtained from wrapping around.

Given `[-4, 5, 1, 0]`, return `6` as we choose the numbers `5` and `1`.

## Problem 853 [Hard]

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.

## Problem 854 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple lines such that each line has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words. If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.

You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.

For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10, you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.

## Problem 855 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You have an N by N board. Write a function that, given N, returns the number of possible arrangements of the board where N queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Problem 856 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Quora.

You are given a list of `(website, user)` pairs that represent users visiting websites. Come up with a program that identifies the top `k` pairs of websites with the greatest similarity.

For example, suppose `k = 1`, and the list of tuples is:

```
[('a', 1), ('a', 3), ('a', 5),
 ('b', 2), ('b', 6),
 ('c', 1), ('c', 2), ('c', 3), ('c', 4), ('c', 5)
 ('d', 4), ('d', 5), ('d', 6), ('d', 7),
 ('e', 1), ('e', 3), ('e': 5), ('e', 6)]
```

Then a reasonable similarity metric would most likely conclude that `a` and `e` are the most similar, so your program should return `[('a', 'e')]`.

## Problem 857 [Hard]

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form `(lr)`, where `l` corresponds to the left child and `r` corresponds to the right child.

If either `l` or `r` is null, it will be represented as a zero. Otherwise, it will be represented by a new `(lr)` pair.

Here are a few examples:

- A root node with no children: `(00)`
- A root node with two children: `((00)(00))`
- An unbalanced tree with three consecutive left children: `((((00)0)0)0)`

Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.

## Problem 858 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:

```
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2
```

## Problem 859 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Yelp.

The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.

More rigorously, we can define it as follows:

- The horizontal distance of the root is 0.
- The horizontal distance of a left child is `hd(parent) - 1`.
- The horizontal distance of a right child is `hd(parent) + 1`.

For example, for the following tree, `hd(1) = -2`, and `hd(6) = 0`.

```
             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \
    1     4    6     9
   /                /
  0                8

The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal distance. If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance, either is acceptable.

For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9]`.

Given the root to a binary tree, return its bottom view.

## Problem 860 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:

- `.` (period) which matches any single character
- `*` (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element

That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid regular expression and returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression.

For example, given the regular expression "ra." and the string "ray", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "raymond" should return false.

Given the regular expression ".*at" and the string "chat", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "chats" should return false.

## Problem 861 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

A knight is placed on a given square on an `8 x 8` chessboard. It is then moved randomly several times, where each move is a standard [knight move](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)#Movement). If the knight jumps off the board at any point, however, it is not allowed to jump back on.

After `k` moves, what is the probability that the knight remains on the board?

## Problem 864 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Glassdoor.

An imminent hurricane threatens the coastal town of Codeville. If at most two people can fit in a rescue boat, and the maximum weight limit for a given boat is `k`, determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.

For example, given a population with weights `[100, 200, 150, 80]` and a boat limit of `200`, the smallest number of boats required will be three.

## Problem 865 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Samsung.

A group of houses is connected to the main water plant by means of a set of pipes. A house can either be connected by a set of pipes extending directly to the plant, or indirectly by a pipe to a nearby house which is otherwise connected.

For example, here is a possible configuration, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are houses, and arrows represent pipes:

```
A <--> B <--> C <--> plant
```

Each pipe has an associated cost, which the utility company would like to minimize. Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water.

In the following setup, for example, we can remove all but the pipes from `plant` to `A`, `plant` to `B`, and `B` to `C`, for a total cost of `16`.

```
pipes = {
    'plant': {'A': 1, 'B': 5, 'C': 20},
    'A': {'C': 15},
    'B': {'C': 10},
    'C': {}
}
```

## Problem 866 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer `k`, return the maximum profit you can make from `k` buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it, and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

For example, given `k` = 2 and the array `[5, 2, 4, 0, 1]`, you should return 3.

## Problem 867 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle of numbers. For example, `[[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]]` represents the triangle:

```
  1
 2 3
1 5 1
```

We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.

## Problem 868 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, `carrace` should return true, since it can be rearranged to form `racecar`, which is a palindrome. `daily` should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

## Problem 869 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if it’s singly linked?

For example, `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1` returns `True` while `1 -> 4` returns `False`.

## Problem 870 [Medium]

This question was asked by Google.

 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 0]]
```

Return 4.

## Problem 871 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Grammarly.

[Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) is an algorithm used to categorize phonetically, such that two names that sound alike but are spelled differently have the same representation.

Soundex maps every name to a string consisting of one letter and three numbers, like M460.

One version of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Remove consecutive consonants with the same sound (for example, change `ck -> c`).
2. Keep the first letter. The remaining steps only apply to the rest of the string.
3. Remove all vowels, including `y`, `w`, and `h`.
4. Replace all consonants with the following digits:
   - b, f, p, v → 1
   - c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2
   - d, t → 3
   - l → 4
   - m, n → 5
   - r → 6
5. If you don't have three numbers yet, append zeros until you do. Keep the first three numbers.

Using this scheme, `Jackson` and `Jaxen` both map to `J250`.

Implement Soundex.

## Problem 873 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Given an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), write a program to evaluate it.

The expression is given as a list of numbers and operands. For example: `[5, 3, '+']` should return `5 + 3 = 8`.

For example, `[15, 7, 1, 1, '+', '-', '/', 3, '*', 2, 1, 1, '+', '+', '-']` should return `5`, since it is equivalent to ((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3) - (2 + (1 + 1)) = 5.

You can assume the given expression is always valid.

## Problem 874 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.

For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

## Problem 875 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains an empty sub-directory `subdir1` and a sub-directory `subdir2` containing a file `file.ext`.

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains two sub-directories `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and an empty second-level sub-directory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a second-level sub-directory `subsubdir2` containing a file `file2.ext`.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`, and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:

The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.

The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.

## Problem 876 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

You are given a list of `N` numbers, in which each number is located at most `k` places away from its sorted position. For example, if `k = 1`, a given element at index `4` might end up at indices `3`, `4`, or `5`.

Come up with an algorithm that sorts this list in `O(N log k)` time.

## Problem 877 [Hard]

## Problem 881 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Uber.

Implement a 2D iterator class. It will be initialized with an array of arrays, and should implement the following methods:

- `next()`: returns the next element in the array of arrays. If there are no more elements, raise an exception.
- `has_next()`: returns whether or not the iterator still has elements left.

For example, given the input [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5, 6]], calling `next()` repeatedly should output `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

Do not use `flatten` or otherwise clone the arrays. Some of the arrays can be empty.

## Problem 882 [Hard]

An 8-puzzle is a game played on a 3 x 3 board of tiles, with the ninth tile missing. The remaining tiles are labeled 1 through 8 but shuffled randomly. Tiles may slide horizontally or vertically into an empty space, but may not be removed from the board.

Design a class to represent the board, and find a series of steps to bring the board to the state [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, None]].

## Problem 883 [Easy]

This problem was asked by PagerDuty.

Given a positive integer `N`, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach `1`.

There are two kinds of permitted steps:

- You may decrement `N` to `N - 1`.
- If `a * b = N`, you may decrement `N` to the larger of `a` and `b`.

For example, given `100`, you can reach `1` in five steps with the following route: `100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`.

## Problem 889 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.

## Problem 890 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

- Right, then down
- Down, then right

Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.

## Problem 891 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Uber.

You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `/`, `\`, or an empty space. Write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.

For example, suppose the input for a three-by-six grid is the following:

```
\    /
 \  /
  \/
```

Considering the edges of the matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three triangles, so you should return `3`.

## Problem 892 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set `{1, 2, 3}`, it should return `{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}`.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set.

Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods: `enqueue`, which inserts an element into the queue, and `dequeue`, which removes it.

## Problem 898 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

- `push(item)`, which adds an element to the stack
- `pop()`, which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:

- `push(item)`, which adds a new key to the heap
- `pop()`, which removes and returns the max value of the heap

## Problem 899 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

The `24` game is played as follows. You are given a list of four integers, each between `1` and `9`, in a fixed order. By placing the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` between the numbers, and grouping them with parentheses, determine whether it is possible to reach the value `24`.

For example, given the input `[5, 2, 7, 8]`, you should return `True`, since `(5 * 2 - 7) * 8 = 24`.

Write a function that plays the `24` game.

## Problem 900 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.

Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.

Do this in O(N) time.
