# Daily Coding Problems 701 - 800

## Daily Coding Problem 701 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

At a popular bar, each customer has a set of favorite drinks, and will happily accept any drink among this set. For example, in the following situation, customer `0` will be satisfied with drinks `0`, `1`, `3`, or `6`.

```
preferences = {
    0: [0, 1, 3, 6],
    1: [1, 4, 7],
    2: [2, 4, 7, 5],
    3: [3, 2, 5],
    4: [5, 8]
}
```

A lazy bartender working at this bar is trying to reduce his effort by limiting the drink recipes he must memorize. Given a dictionary input such as the one above, return the fewest number of drinks he must learn in order to satisfy all customers.

For the input above, the answer would be `2`, as drinks `1` and `5` will satisfy everyone.

## Daily Coding Problem 702 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root to a binary tree, implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree.

For example, given the following `Node` class

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

The following test should pass:

```
node = Node('root', Node('left', Node('left.left')), Node('right'))
assert deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val == 'left.left'
```

## Daily Coding Problem 703 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

A knight is placed on a given square on an `8 x 8` chessboard. It is then moved randomly several times, where each move is a standard [knight move](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)#Movement). If the knight jumps off the board at any point, however, it is not allowed to jump back on.

After `k` moves, what is the probability that the knight remains on the board?

## Daily Coding Problem 704 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Uber.

One way to unlock an Android phone is through a pattern of swipes across a `1-9` keypad.

For a pattern to be valid, it must satisfy the following:

- All of its keys must be distinct.
- It must not connect two keys by jumping over a third key, unless that key has already been used.

For example, `4 - 2 - 1 - 7` is a valid pattern, whereas `2 - 1 - 7` is not.

Find the total number of valid unlock patterns of length `N`, where `1 <= N <= 9`.

## Daily Coding Problem 705 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height. Suppose it will rain and all spots between two walls get filled up.

Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1) space.

For example, given the input [2, 1, 2], we can hold 1 unit of water in the middle.

Given the input [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5], we can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off to the left), so we can trap 8 units of water.

## Daily Coding Problem 706 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

The `24` game is played as follows. You are given a list of four integers, each between `1` and `9`, in a fixed order. By placing the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` between the numbers, and grouping them with parentheses, determine whether it is possible to reach the value `24`.

For example, given the input `[5, 2, 7, 8]`, you should return `True`, since `(5 * 2 - 7) * 8 = 24`.

Write a function that plays the `24` game.

## Daily Coding Problem 707 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You are the technical director of WSPT radio, serving listeners nationwide. For simplicity's sake we can consider each listener to live along a horizontal line stretching from `0` (west) to `1000` (east).

Given a list of `N` listeners, and a list of `M` radio towers, each placed at various locations along this line, determine what the minimum broadcast range would have to be in order for each listener's home to be covered.

For example, suppose `listeners = [1, 5, 11, 20]`, and `towers = [4, 8, 15]`. In this case the minimum range would be `5`, since that would be required for the tower at position `15` to reach the listener at position `20`.

## Daily Coding Problem 708 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Apple.

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return `False`.

For example, given `[-6, 0, 2, 40]`, you should return `2`. Given `[1, 5, 7, 8]`, you should return `False`.

## Daily Coding Problem 709 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given an N by M matrix of `0`s and `1`s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. `0` represents an empty space while `1` represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
```

Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

- Right, down, down, right
- Down, right, down, right

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be `0`.

## Daily Coding Problem 710 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a string `s` and a list of words `words`, where each word is the same length, find all starting indices of substrings in `s` that is a concatenation of every word in `words` exactly once.

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], return [0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in `s`.

The order of the indices does not matter.

## Daily Coding Problem 711 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Nvidia.

You are given a list of `N` points `(x``1``, y``1``)`, `(x``2``, y``2``)`, ..., `(x``N``, y``N``)` representing a polygon. You can assume these points are given in order; that is, you can construct the polygon by connecting point `1` to point `2`, point `2` to point `3`, and so on, finally looping around to connect point `N` to point `1`.

Determine if a new point `p` lies inside this polygon. (If `p` is on the boundary of the polygon, you should return `False`).

## Daily Coding Problem 712 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed).

For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true.

Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false.

## Daily Coding Problem 713 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Quora.

Given an absolute pathname that may have `.` or `..` as part of it, return the shortest standardized path.

For example, given "/usr/bin/../bin/./scripts/../", return "/usr/bin/".

## Daily Coding Problem 714 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the head of a singly linked list, swap every two nodes and return its head.

For example, given `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`, return `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3`.

## Daily Coding Problem 715 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if it’s singly linked?

For example, `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1` returns `True` while `1 -> 4` returns `False`.

## Daily Coding Problem 716 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, €, corresponds to the three bytes `11100010 10000010 10101100`. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

- For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
- For an `n`-byte character, the first byte starts with `n` ones and a zero. The other `n - 1` bytes all start with `10`.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Daily Coding Problem 717 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.

Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.

## Daily Coding Problem 718 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Apple.

[Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) is a binary code where each successive value differ in only one bit, as well as when wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary spurious values during transitions.

Given a number of bits `n`, generate a possible gray code for it.

For example, for n = `2`, one gray code would be `[00, 01, 11, 10]`.

## Daily Coding Problem 719 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Spreadsheets often use this alphabetical encoding for its columns: "A", "B", "C", ..., "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ", "AAA", "AAB", ....

Given a column number, return its alphabetical column id. For example, given `1`, return "A". Given `27`, return "AA".

## Daily Coding Problem 720 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Sudoku is a puzzle where you're given a partially-filled 9 by 9 grid with digits. The objective is to fill the grid with the constraint that every row, column, and box (3 by 3 subgrid) must contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Implement an efficient sudoku solver.

## Daily Coding Problem 721 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Recall that the minimum spanning tree is the subset of edges of a tree that connect all its vertices with the smallest possible total edge weight. Given an undirected graph with weighted edges, compute the *maximum* weight spanning tree.

## Daily Coding Problem 722 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

There are `N` couples sitting in a row of length `2 * N`. They are currently ordered randomly, but would like to rearrange themselves so that each couple's partners can sit side by side.

What is the minimum number of swaps necessary for this to happen?

## Daily Coding Problem 723 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals `[0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9]`, one set of numbers that covers all these intervals is `{3, 6}`.

## Daily Coding Problem 724 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
```

You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).

## Daily Coding Problem 725 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Consider the following scenario: there are `N` mice and `N` holes placed at integer points along a line. Given this, find a method that maps mice to holes such that the largest number of steps any mouse takes is minimized.

Each move consists of moving one mouse one unit to the left or right, and only one mouse can fit inside each hole.

For example, suppose the mice are positioned at `[1, 4, 9, 15]`, and the holes are located at `[10, -5, 0, 16]`. In this case, the best pairing would require us to send the mouse at `1` to the hole at `-5`, so our function should return `6`.

## Daily Coding Problem 726 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Implement the singleton pattern with a twist. First, instead of storing one instance, store two instances. And in every even call of `getInstance()`, return the first instance and in every odd call of `getInstance()`, return the second instance.

## Daily Coding Problem 727 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:

```
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2
```

## Daily Coding Problem 728 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

A teacher must divide a class of students into two teams to play dodgeball. Unfortunately, not all the kids get along, and several refuse to be put on the same team as that of their enemies.

Given an adjacency list of students and their enemies, write an algorithm that finds a satisfactory pair of teams, or returns `False` if none exists.

For example, given the following enemy graph you should return the teams `{0, 1, 4, 5}` and `{2, 3}`.

```
students = {
    0: [3],
    1: [2],
    2: [1, 4],
    3: [0, 4, 5],
    4: [2, 3],
    5: [3]
}
```

On the other hand, given the input below, you should return `False`.

```
students = {
    0: [3],
    1: [2],
    2: [1, 3, 4],
    3: [0, 2, 4, 5],
    4: [2, 3],
    5: [3]
}
```

## Daily Coding Problem 729 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You have access to ranked lists of songs for various users. Each song is represented as an integer, and more preferred songs appear earlier in each list. For example, the list `[4, 1, 7]` indicates that a user likes song `4` the best, followed by songs `1` and `7`.

Given a set of these ranked lists, interleave them to create a playlist that satisfies everyone's priorities.

For example, suppose your input is `{[1, 7, 3], [2, 1, 6, 7, 9], [3, 9, 5]}`. In this case a satisfactory playlist could be `[2, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5]`.

## Daily Coding Problem 730 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

What will this code print out?

```
def make_functions():
    flist = []

    for i in [1, 2, 3]:
        def print_i():
            print(i)
        flist.append(print_i)

    return flist

functions = make_functions()
for f in functions:
    f()
```

How can we make it print out what we apparently want?

## Daily Coding Problem 731 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

## Daily Coding Problem 732 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Glassdoor.

An imminent hurricane threatens the coastal town of Codeville. If at most two people can fit in a rescue boat, and the maximum weight limit for a given boat is `k`, determine how many boats will be needed to save everyone.

For example, given a population with weights `[100, 200, 150, 80]` and a boat limit of `200`, the smallest number of boats required will be three.

## Daily Coding Problem 733 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Salesforce.

Connect 4 is a game where opponents take turns dropping red or black discs into a `7 x 6` vertically suspended grid. The game ends either when one player creates a line of four consecutive discs of their color (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when there are no more spots left in the grid.

Design and implement Connect 4.

## Daily Coding Problem 734 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time.

It should contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value, time)`: sets key to value for t = time.
- `get(key, time)`: gets the key at t = time.

The map should work like this. If we set a key at a particular time, it will maintain that value forever or until it gets set at a later time. In other words, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value that was set for that key set at the most recent time.

Consider the following examples:

```
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2
d.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null
d.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 0) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 0
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be 2
```

## Daily Coding Problem 735 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Sumo Logic.

Given an unsorted array, in which all elements are distinct, find a "peak" element in `O(log N)` time.

An element is considered a peak if it is greater than both its left and right neighbors. It is guaranteed that the first and last elements are lower than all others.

## Daily Coding Problem 736 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes in faster than O(n) time. Recall that a complete binary tree has every level filled except the last, and the nodes in the last level are filled starting from the left.

## Daily Coding Problem 737 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

We're given a hashmap associating each `courseId` key with a list of `courseIds` values, which represents that the prerequisites of `courseId` are `courseIds`. Return a sorted ordering of courses such that we can finish all courses.

Return null if there is no such ordering.

For example, given {'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 'CSC200': ['CSC100'], 'CSC100': []}, should return ['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSCS300'].

## Daily Coding Problem 738 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple lines such that each line has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words. If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.

You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.

For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10, you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.

## Daily Coding Problem 739 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues. It can be viewed as a list of elements written left to right such that three operations are possible:

- `push(x)`: add a new item `x` to the left end of the list
- `pop()`: remove and return the item on the left end of the list
- `pull()`: remove the item on the right end of the list.

Implement a quack using three stacks and `O(1)` additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or pull operation is `O(1)`.

## Daily Coding Problem 740 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

A regular number in mathematics is defined as one which evenly divides some power of `60`. Equivalently, we can say that a regular number is one whose only prime divisors are `2`, `3`, and `5`.

These numbers have had many applications, from helping ancient Babylonians keep time to tuning instruments according to the diatonic scale.

Given an integer `N`, write a program that returns, in order, the first `N` regular numbers.

## Daily Coding Problem 741 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a string consisting of parentheses, single digits, and positive and negative signs, convert the string into a mathematical expression to obtain the answer.

Don't use `eval` or a similar built-in parser.

For example, given '-1 + (2 + 3)', you should return `4`.

## Daily Coding Problem 742 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Write a function to flatten a nested dictionary. Namespace the keys with a period.

For example, given the following dictionary:

```
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo": {
        "a": 5,
        "bar": {
            "baz": 8
        }
    }
}
```

it should become:

```
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo.a": 5,
    "foo.bar.baz": 8
}
```

You can assume keys do not contain dots in them, i.e. no clobbering will occur.

## Daily Coding Problem 743 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Mozilla.

A bridge in a connected (undirected) graph is an edge that, if removed, causes the graph to become disconnected. Find all the bridges in a graph.

## Daily Coding Problem 744 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement an LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value)`: sets `key` to `value`. If there are already `n` items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least frequently used item. If there is a tie, then the least recently used key should be removed.
- `get(key)`: gets the value at `key`. If no such key exists, return null.

Each operation should run in O(1) time.

## Daily Coding Problem 745 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Triplebyte.

Implement a data structure which carries out the following operations without resizing the underlying array:

- `add(value)`: Add a value to the set of values.
- `check(value)`: Check whether a value is in the set.

The `check` method may return occasional false positives (in other words, incorrectly identifying an element as part of the set), but should always correctly identify a true element.

## Daily Coding Problem 746 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a stack that has the following methods:

- push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
- pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
- max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.

Each method should run in constant time.

## Daily Coding Problem 747 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two strings A and B, return whether or not A can be shifted some number of times to get B.

For example, if A is `abcde` and B is `cdeab`, return true. If A is `abc` and B is `acb`, return false.

## Daily Coding Problem 748 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Apple.

Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all values under a node, including the node itself.

For example, given the following tree:

```
  5
 / \
2  -5
```

Return `2` as it occurs twice: once as the left leaf, and once as the sum of `2 + 5 - 5`.

## Daily Coding Problem 749 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.

For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

## Daily Coding Problem 750 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Generate a finite, but an arbitrarily large binary tree quickly in O(1).

That is, `generate()` should return a tree whose size is unbounded but finite.

## Daily Coding Problem 751 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has `O(h)` space complexity, where `h` is the height of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using `O(1)` space.

## Daily Coding Problem 752 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise. For example, the following should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

```
  1
 / \
2   3
   / \
  4   5
```

## Daily Coding Problem 753 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Zillow.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up to three children. Here is an example which represents the words `code`, `cob`, `be`, `ax`, `war`, and `we`.

```
       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \ 
x   b  e   r  e  
```

The tree is structured according to the following rules:

- left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent prefix
- right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent prefix
- middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since `code` is the first word inserted in the tree, and `cob` lexicographically precedes `cod`, `cob` is represented as a left child extending from `cod`.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.

## Daily Coding Problem 754 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Square.

In front of you is a row of `N` coins, with values `v``1`, `v``1`, ..., `v``n`.

You are asked to play the following game. You and an opponent take turns choosing either the first or last coin from the row, removing it from the row, and receiving the value of the coin.

Write a program that returns the maximum amount of money you can win with certainty, if you move first, assuming your opponent plays optimally.

## Daily Coding Problem 755 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.

Given a graph with `n` nodes and `m` directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return null.

The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The `i`-th character represents the uppercase letter of the `i`-th node. Each tuple in the edge list `(i, j)` means there is a directed edge from the `i`-th node to the `j`-th node. Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.

For example, the following input graph:

```
ABACA
[(0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 4)]
```

Would have maximum value 3 using the path of vertices `[0, 2, 3, 4]`, `(A, A, C, A)`.

The following input graph:

```
A
[(0, 0)]
```

Should return null, since we have an infinite loop.

## Daily Coding Problem 756 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.

For example, the input could be 'niesevehrtfeev', which is an anagram of 'threefiveseven'. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.

Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example above, this would be `357`.

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a two player card game whose rules are as follows:

- The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
- The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed `21`.
- The dealer must then hit if their total is `16` or lower, otherwise pass.
- Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding `21` is the winner.

For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between `2` and `10` counts as their face value, face cards count as `10`, and aces count as `1`.

Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses).

This problem was asked by Snapchat.

Given a string of digits, generate all possible valid IP address combinations.

IP addresses must follow the format A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are numbers between `0` and `255`. Zero-prefixed numbers, such as `01` and `065`, are not allowed, except for `0` itself.

For example, given "2542540123", you should return ['254.25.40.123', '254.254.0.123'].

## Daily Coding Problem 762 [Hard]

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.

## Daily Coding Problem 763 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:

- 10 = max(10, 5, 2)
- 7 = max(5, 2, 7)
- 8 = max(2, 7, 8)
- 8 = max(7, 8, 7)

Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

## Daily Coding Problem 770 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

The game of Nim is played as follows. Starting with three heaps, each containing a variable number of items, two players take turns removing one or more items from a single pile. The player who eventually is forced to take the last stone loses. For example, if the initial heap sizes are `3`, `4`, and `5`, a game could be played as shown below:

```
  A  |  B  |  C
-----------------
  3  |  4  |  5
  3  |  1  |  3
  3  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  0
  0  |  0  |  0 
```

In other words, to start, the first player takes three items from pile `B`. The second player responds by removing two stones from pile `C`. The game continues in this way until player one takes last stone and loses.

Given a list of non-zero starting values `[a, b, c]`, and assuming optimal play, determine whether the first player has a forced win.

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string `s1` to another `s2`.

For example, given `s1 = abc` and `s2 = bcd`, return `true` since we can map `a` to `b`, `b` to `c`, and `c` to `d`.

Given `s1 = foo` and `s2 = bar`, return `false` since the `o` cannot map to two characters.

Boggle is a game played on a `4 x 4` grid of letters. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters in the grid, using each cell at most once. Given a game board and a dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.

## Daily Coding Problem 773 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has. Two elements `A[i]` and `A[j]` form an inversion if `A[i] > A[j]` but `i < j`. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.

Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.

You may assume each element in the array is distinct.

For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.

## Daily Coding Problem 776 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

There are `N` prisoners standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. The executions are carried out starting with the `k`th person, and removing every successive `k`th person going clockwise until there is no one left.

Given `N` and `k`, write an algorithm to determine where a prisoner should stand in order to be the last survivor.

For example, if `N = 5` and `k = 2`, the order of executions would be `[2, 4, 1, 5, 3]`, so you should return `3`.

Bonus: Find an `O(log N)` solution if `k = 2`.

## Daily Coding Problem 777 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Zillow.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up to three children. Here is an example which represents the words `code`, `cob`, `be`, `ax`, `war`, and `we`.

```
       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \ 
x   b  e   r  e  
```

The tree is structured according to the following rules:

- left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent prefix
- right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent prefix
- middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since `code` is the first word inserted in the tree, and `cob` lexicographically precedes `cod`, `cob` is represented as a left child extending from `cod`.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.

## Daily Coding Problem 778 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You have access to ranked lists of songs for various users. Each song is represented as an integer, and more preferred songs appear earlier in each list. For example, the list `[4, 1, 7]` indicates that a user likes song `4` the best, followed by songs `1` and `7`.

Given a set of these ranked lists, interleave them to create a playlist that satisfies everyone's priorities.

For example, suppose your input is `{[1, 7, 3], [2, 1, 6, 7, 9], [3, 9, 5]}`. In this case a satisfactory playlist could be `[2, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5]`.

## Daily Coding Problem 779 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Goldman Sachs.

You are given `N` identical eggs and access to a building with `k` floors. Your task is to find the lowest floor that will cause an egg to break, if dropped from that floor. Once an egg breaks, it cannot be dropped again. If an egg breaks when dropped from the `x``th` floor, you can assume it will also break when dropped from any floor greater than `x`.

Write an algorithm that finds the minimum number of trial drops it will take, in the worst case, to identify this floor.

For example, if `N = 1` and `k = 5`, we will need to try dropping the egg at every floor, beginning with the first, until we reach the fifth floor, so our solution will be `5`.

```
[['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
 ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]

## Daily Coding Problem 792 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Uber.

You have `N` stones in a row, and would like to create from them a pyramid. This pyramid should be constructed such that the height of each stone increases by one until reaching the tallest stone, after which the heights decrease by one. In addition, the start and end stones of the pyramid should each be one stone high.

You can change the height of any stone by paying a cost of `1` unit to lower its height by `1`, as many times as necessary. Given this information, determine the lowest cost method to produce this pyramid.

For example, given the stones `[1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1]`, the optimal solution is to pay `2` to create `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.
