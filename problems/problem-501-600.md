## Daily Coding Problem 509 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Quora.

Given a string, find the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters as possible anywhere in the word. If there is more than one palindrome of minimum length that can be made, return the lexicographically earliest one (the first one alphabetically).

For example, given the string "race", you should return "ecarace", since we can add three letters to it (which is the smallest amount to make a palindrome). There are seven other palindromes that can be made from "race" by adding three letters, but "ecarace" comes first alphabetically.

As another example, given the string "google", you should return "elgoogle".

## Daily Coding Problem 510 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

Given a list of words, find all pairs of unique indices such that the concatenation of the two words is a palindrome.

This problem was asked by Yelp.

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given `[6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]`, you should return `2`, as the optimal solution involves jumping from `6` to `5`, and then from `5` to `9`.

## Daily Coding Problem 512 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of nonnegative integers. Let's say you start at the beginning of the array and are trying to advance to the end. You can advance at most, the number of steps that you're currently on. Determine whether you can get to the end of the array.

For example, given the array `[1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1]`, we can go from indices `0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5`, so return `true`.

Given the array `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`, we can't reach the end, so return `false`.

## Daily Coding Problem 513 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Lyft.

Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.

For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, then it should return [2, 3, 4], since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

## Daily Coding Problem 514 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`, the longest consecutive element sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Return its length: `4`.

Your algorithm should run in `O(n)` complexity.

## Daily Coding Problem 515 (Medium)

## Daily Coding Problem 517 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.

## Daily Coding Problem 518 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given an array of numbers and a number `k`, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number `k`. For example, given `[20, 303, 3, 4, 25]` and `k = 49`, return `true` as `20 + 4 + 25 = 49`.

## Daily Coding Problem 519 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

## Daily Coding Problem 520 (Hard)

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form `(lr)`, where `l` corresponds to the left child and `r` corresponds to the right child.

If either `l` or `r` is null, it will be represented as a zero. Otherwise, it will be represented by a new `(lr)` pair.

Here are a few examples:

- A root node with no children: `(00)`
- A root node with two children: `((00)(00))`
- An unbalanced tree with three consecutive left children: `((((00)0)0)0)`

Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.

## Daily Coding Problem 521 (Medium)

This problem was asked by PayPal.

Given a string and a number of lines `k`, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the `k``th` line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence `"thisisazigzag"` and `k = 4`, you should print:

```
t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g
```

## Daily Coding Problem 522 (Medium)

- `a + b = M`
- `a XOR b = N`

## Daily Coding Problem 524 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.

Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.

Do this in O(N) time.

 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
```

You should print out the following:

```
1

10
15
20
19
18
17
16

```

## Daily Coding Problem 526 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Yahoo.

You are given a string of length `N` and a parameter `k`. The string can be manipulated by taking one of the first `k` letters and moving it to the end.

Write a program to determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be created after an unlimited number of moves.

  3      3
 / \    / \
1   2  2   1
```

## Daily Coding Problem 528 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as `0101` or `111110`, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a `0` in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to `1`.

Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):

```
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s
```

With this encoding, `cats` would be represented as `0000110111`.

Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.

## Daily Coding Problem 529 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a string, split it into as few strings as possible such that each string is a palindrome.w

For example, given the input string `racecarannakayak`, return `["racecar", "anna", "kayak"]`.

Given the input string `abc`, return `["a", "b", "c"]`.

## Daily Coding Problem 530 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Google.

The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the other. For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three: substitute the “k” for “s”, substitute the “e” for “i”, and append a “g”.

Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.

## Daily Coding Problem 531 (Easy)

This problem was asked Microsoft.

## Daily Coding Problem 532 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1).

For example, given M = 5 and the list of bishops:

- (0, 0)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 2)
- (4, 0)

The board would look like this:

```
[b 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[b 0 0 0 0]
```

You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 3 and 4.

## Daily Coding Problem 533 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Boggle is a game played on a `4 x 4` grid of letters. The goal is to find as many words as possible that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent letters in the grid, using each cell at most once. Given a game board and a dictionary of valid words, implement a Boggle solver.

## Daily Coding Problem 534 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, `carrace` should return true, since it can be rearranged to form `racecar`, which is a palindrome. `daily` should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

## Daily Coding Problem 535 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Goldman Sachs.

You are given `N` identical eggs and access to a building with `k` floors. Your task is to find the lowest floor that will cause an egg to break, if dropped from that floor. Once an egg breaks, it cannot be dropped again. If an egg breaks when dropped from the `x``th` floor, you can assume it will also break when dropped from any floor greater than `x`.

Write an algorithm that finds the minimum number of trial drops it will take, in the worst case, to identify this floor.

For example, if `N = 1` and `k = 5`, we will need to try dropping the egg at every floor, beginning with the first, until we reach the fifth floor, so our solution will be `5`.

## Daily Coding Problem 536 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

Given a set of characters `C` and an integer `k`, a De Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible `k`-length string of characters in `C` occurs exactly once.

For example, suppose `C = {0, 1}` and `k = 3`. Then our sequence should contain the substrings `{'000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111'}`, and one possible solution would be `00010111`.

Create an algorithm that finds a De Bruijn sequence.

In Ancient Greece, it was common to write text with the first line going left to right, the second line going right to left, and continuing to go back and forth. This style was called "boustrophedon".

Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to print the nodes in boustrophedon order.

For example, given the following tree:

```
       1
    /     \
  2         3
 / \       / \
4   5     6   7
```

You should return `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

## Daily Coding Problem 541 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.

Do this in constant space and in one pass.

## Daily Coding Problem 544 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k. If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.

For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it sums up to 24.

## Daily Coding Problem 545 (Hard)

Assume you have access to a function `toss_biased()` which returns 0 or 1 with a probability that's not 50-50 (but also not 0-100 or 100-0). You do not know the bias of the coin.

Write a function to simulate an unbiased coin toss.

## Daily Coding Problem 552 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Wayfair.

You are given a `2 x N` board, and instructed to completely cover the board with the following shapes:

- Dominoes, or `2 x 1` rectangles.
- Trominoes, or `L`-shapes.

For example, if `N = 4`, here is one possible configuration, where `A` is a domino, and `B` and `C` are trominoes.

```
A B B C
A B C C
```

Given an integer `N`, determine in how many ways this task is possible.

## Daily Coding Problem 553 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

```
cba
daf
ghi
```

This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:

```
ca
df
gi
```

So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

```
abcdef
```

Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

As another example, given the following table:

```
zyx
wvu
tsr
```

Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.

554 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Palantir.

The ancient Egyptians used to express fractions as a sum of several terms where each numerator is one. For example, `4 / 13` can be represented as `1 / 4 + 1 / 18 + 1 / 468`.

Create an algorithm to turn an ordinary fraction `a / b`, where `a < b`, into an Egyptian fraction.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.

Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element doesn't exist in the array, return null.

For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).

You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.

556 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.

Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

557 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Apple.

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the `i`-th row and `j`-th column is `(i + 1) * (j + 1)` (if 0-indexed) or `i * j` (if 1-indexed).

Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the multiplication table looks like this:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |

| 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

| 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |

| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |

| 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |

And there are 4 12's in the table.

`cons(a, b)` constructs a pair, and `car(pair)` and `cdr(pair)` returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, `car(cons(3, 4))` returns `3`, and `cdr(cons(3, 4))` returns `4`.

Given this implementation of cons:

```
def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair
```

Implement `car` and `cdr`.

Given two non-empty binary trees `s` and `t`, check whether tree `t` has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of `s`. A subtree of `s` is a tree consists of a node in `s` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `s` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

## Daily Coding Problem 571 (Medium)

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game with three rods and n disks, each a different size.

All the disks start off on the first rod in a stack. They are ordered by size, with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest one at the top.

The goal of this puzzle is to move all the disks from the first rod to the last rod while following these rules:

- You can only move one disk at a time.
- A move consists of taking the uppermost disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
- You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

Write a function that prints out all the steps necessary to complete the Tower of Hanoi. You should assume that the rods are numbered, with the first rod being 1, the second (auxiliary) rod being 2, and the last (goal) rod being 3.

For example, with n = 3, we can do this in 7 moves:

```
Move 1 to 3
Move 1 to 2
Move 3 to 2
Move 1 to 3
Move 2 to 1
Move 2 to 3
Move 1 to 3
```

## Daily Coding Problem 572 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there is not greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.

For example, the list `[1,2,3]` should return `[1,3,2]`. The list `[1,3,2]` should return `[2,1,3]`. The list `[3,2,1]` should return `[1,2,3]`.

Can you perform the operation without allocating extra memory (disregarding the input memory)?

## Daily Coding Problem 573 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.

Implement a bit array.

A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of `1` or `0` at each index.

- `init(size)`: initialize the array with `size`
- `set(i, val)`: updates index at `i` with `val` where `val` is either `1` or `0`.
- `get(i)`: gets the value at index `i`.

## Daily Coding Problem 575 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Uber.

Implement a 2D iterator class. It will be initialized with an array of arrays, and should implement the following methods:

- `next()`: returns the next element in the array of arrays. If there are no more elements, raise an exception.
- `has_next()`: returns whether or not the iterator still has elements left.

For example, given the input [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5, 6]], calling `next()` repeatedly should output `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

Do not use `flatten` or otherwise clone the arrays. Some of the arrays can be empty.

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string `s1` to another `s2`.

For example, given `s1 = abc` and `s2 = bcd`, return `true` since we can map `a` to `b`, `b` to `c`, and `c` to `d`.

Given `s1 = foo` and `s2 = bar`, return `false` since the `o` cannot map to two characters.

## Daily Coding Problem 586 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Quora.

You are given a list of `(website, user)` pairs that represent users visiting websites. Come up with a program that identifies the top `k` pairs of websites with the greatest similarity.

For example, suppose `k = 1`, and the list of tuples is:

```python
[('a', 1), ('a', 3), ('a', 5),
 ('b', 2), ('b', 6),
 ('c', 1), ('c', 2), ('c', 3), ('c', 4), ('c', 5)
 ('d', 4), ('d', 5), ('d', 6), ('d', 7),
 ('e', 1), ('e', 3), ('e': 5), ('e', 6)]
```

Then a reasonable similarity metric would most likely conclude that `a` and `e` are the most similar, so your program should return `[('a', 'e')]`.

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding `next` and `prev` fields, it holds a field named `both`, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an `add(element)` which adds the element to the end, and a `get(index)` which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to `get_pointer` and `dereference_pointer` functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

Word sense disambiguation is the problem of determining which sense a word takes on in a particular setting, if that word has multiple meanings. For example, in the sentence "I went to get money from the *bank*", bank probably means the place where people deposit money, not the land beside a river or lake.

Suppose you are given a list of meanings for several words, formatted like so:

```
{
    "word_1": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...],
    ...
    "word_n": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...]
}
```

Given a sentence, most of whose words are contained in the meaning list above, create an algorithm that determines the likely sense of each possibly ambiguous word.

You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.

For example, given the array `[3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1]`, you should return `3`, since the top floors of the buildings with heights `8`, `6`, and `1` all have an unobstructed view to the west.

Can you do this using just one forward pass through the array?

## Daily Coding Problem 594 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words. Find the maximum number of words that can be packed on the board from the given dictionary.

A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:

- It can be found in the dictionary
- It can be constructed from untaken letters by other words found so far on the board
- The letters are adjacent to each other (vertically and horizontally, not diagonally).

Each tile can be visited only once by any word.

For example, given the following dictionary:

```
{ 'eat', 'rain', 'in', 'rat' }
```

and matrix:

```
[['e', 'a', 'n'],
 ['t', 't', 'i'],
 ['a', 'r', 'a']]
```

Your function should return 3, since we can make the words 'eat', 'in', and 'rat' without them touching each other. We could have alternatively made 'eat' and 'rain', but that would be incorrect since that's only 2 words.

This problem was asked by Salesforce.

The number 6174 is known as Kaprekar's contant, after the mathematician who discovered an associated property: for all four-digit numbers with at least two distinct digits, repeatedly applying a simple procedure eventually results in this value. The procedure is as follows:

- For a given input `x`, create two new numbers that consist of the digits in `x` in ascending and descending order.
- Subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

For example, this algorithm terminates in three steps when starting from `1234`:

- `4321 - 1234 = 3087`
- `8730 - 0378 = 8352`
- `8532 - 2358 = 6174`

Write a function that returns how many steps this will take for a given input `N`.

- Player 1: `o`
- Player 2: `s`
- Player 1: `t` [loses]

Given a dictionary of words, determine the letters the first player should start with, such that with optimal play they cannot lose.

For example, if the dictionary is `["cat", "calf", "dog", "bear"]`, the only winning start letter would be `b`.
