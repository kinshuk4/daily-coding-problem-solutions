## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1703 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Goldman Sachs.

Given a list of numbers `L`, implement a method `sum(i, j)` which returns the sum from the sublist `L[i:j]` (including `i`, excluding `j`).

For example, given `L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `sum(1, 3)` should return `sum([2, 3])`, which is `5`.

You can assume that you can do some pre-processing. `sum()` should be optimized over the pre-processing step.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1702 [Medium]

This question was asked by Google.

Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[1, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 0]]
```

Return 4.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1701 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Uber.

On election day, a voting machine writes data in the form `(voter_id, candidate_id)` to a text file. Write a program that reads this file as a stream and returns the top `3` candidates at any given time. If you find a voter voting more than once, report this as fraud.
