## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #801 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Zillow.

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of `7`, or the sum of unique powers of `7`. The first few sevenish numbers are `1`, `7`, `8`, `49`, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the `n`th sevenish number.

You are given `n` numbers as well as `n` probabilities that sum up to 1. Write a function to generate one of the numbers with its corresponding probability.

For example, given the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and probabilities `[0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2]`, your function should return `1` 10% of the time, `2` 50% of the time, and 3 and 4 20% of the time.

You can generate random numbers between 0 and 1 uniformly.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #803 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number with all distinct digits.

Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the secret code. For example, if the secret code were `123456`, then a guess of `175286` would score two, since `1` and `6` were correctly placed.

Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores, determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.

For example, for the following scores you should return `True`, since they correspond to the secret code `123456`:

```
{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}
```

However, it is impossible for any key to result in the following scores, so in this case you should return `False`:

```
{123456: 4, 345678: 4, 567890: 4}
```
