Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of `7`, or the sum of unique powers of `7`. The first few sevenish numbers are `1`, `7`, `8`, `49`, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the `n`th sevenish number.

This problem was asked by Triplebyte.

You are given `n` numbers as well as `n` probabilities that sum up to 1. Write a function to generate one of the numbers with its corresponding probability.

For example, given the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and probabilities `[0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2]`, your function should return `1` 10% of the time, `2` 50% of the time, and 3 and 4 20% of the time.

You can generate random numbers between 0 and 1 uniformly.

Mastermind is a two-player game in which the first player attempts to guess the secret code of the second. In this version, the code may be any six-digit number with all distinct digits.

Each turn the first player guesses some number, and the second player responds by saying how many digits in this number correctly matched their location in the secret code. For example, if the secret code were `123456`, then a guess of `175286` would score two, since `1` and `6` were correctly placed.

Write an algorithm which, given a sequence of guesses and their scores, determines whether there exists some secret code that could have produced them.

For example, for the following scores you should return `True`, since they correspond to the secret code `123456`:

```
{175286: 2, 293416: 3, 654321: 0}
```

However, it is impossible for any key to result in the following scores, so in this case you should return `False`:

```
{123456: 4, 345678: 4, 567890: 4}
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #804 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

You are given a huge list of airline ticket prices between different cities around the world on a given day. These are all direct flights. Each element in the list has the format `(source_city, destination, price)`.

Consider a user who is willing to take up to `k` connections from their origin city `A` to their destination `B`. Find the cheapest fare possible for this journey and print the itinerary for that journey.

For example, our traveler wants to go from `JFK` to `LAX` with up to `3` connections, and our input flights are as follows:

```
[
    ('JFK', 'ATL', 150),
    ('ATL', 'SFO', 400),
    ('ORD', 'LAX', 200),
    ('LAX', 'DFW', 80),
    ('JFK', 'HKG', 800),
    ('ATL', 'ORD', 90),
    ('JFK', 'LAX', 500),
]
```

Due to some improbably low flight prices, the cheapest itinerary would be `JFK -> ATL -> ORD -> LAX`, costing $440.

Spreadsheets often use this alphabetical encoding for its columns: "A", "B", "C", ..., "AA", "AB", ..., "ZZ", "AAA", "AAB", ....

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #806 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Let A be an N by M matrix in which every row and every column is sorted.

Given i1, j1, i2, and j2, compute the number of elements of M smaller than M[i1, j1] and larger than M[i2, j2].

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 20],
 [2, 6, 9, 14, 22, 25],
 [3, 8, 10, 15, 25, 30],
 [10, 11, 12, 23, 30, 35],
 [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45]]
```

And i1 = 1, j1 = 1, i2 = 3, j2 = 3, return 15 as there are 15 numbers in the matrix smaller than 6 or greater than 23.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #810 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Morgan Stanley.

In Ancient Greece, it was common to write text with the first line going left to right, the second line going right to left, and continuing to go back and forth. This style was called "boustrophedon".

Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to print the nodes in boustrophedon order.

For example, given the following tree:

```
       1
    /     \
  2         3
 / \       / \
4   5     6   7
```

You should return `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on game results.

A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a 2000-ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player.

Implement this system.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #813 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.

Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #814 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

For example, given

```
9 -> 9
5 -> 2
```

return 124 (99 + 25) as:

```
4 -> 2 -> 1
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #817 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given a dictionary of words and a string made up of those words (no spaces), return the original sentence in a list. If there is more than one possible reconstruction, return any of them. If there is no possible reconstruction, then return null.

For example, given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string "thequickbrownfox", you should return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'].

Given the set of words 'bed', 'bath', 'bedbath', 'and', 'beyond', and the string "bedbathandbeyond", return either ['bed', 'bath', 'and', 'beyond] or ['bedbath', 'and', 'beyond'].

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #818 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Square.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than `N`. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.

For example, to find all primes less than `100`, we would first mark `[4, 6, 8, ...]` (multiples of two), then `[6, 9, 12, ...]` (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than `N`, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.

Implement this algorithm.

Bonus: Create a generator that produces primes indefinitely (that is, without taking `N` as an input).

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #820 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input `[3, 4, -1, 1]` should give `2`. The input `[1, 2, 0]` should give `3`.

You can modify the input array in-place.

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return `False`.

For example, given `[-6, 0, 2, 40]`, you should return `2`. Given `[1, 5, 7, 8]`, you should return `False`.

Implement a bit array.

A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of `1` or `0` at each index.

- `init(size)`: initialize the array with `size`
- `set(i, val)`: updates index at `i` with `val` where `val` is either `1` or `0`.
- `get(i)`: gets the value at index `i`.
