## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1206 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Uber.

A rule looks like this:

```
A NE B
```

This means this means point `A` is located northeast of point `B`.

```
A SW C
```

means that point `A` is southwest of `C`.

Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate. For example:

```
A N B
B NE C
C N A
```

does not validate, since `A` cannot be both north and south of `C`.

```
A NW B
A N B
```

is considered valid.

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

For example, given

```
9 -> 9
5 -> 2
```

return 124 (99 + 25) as:

```
4 -> 2 -> 1
```

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

You come across a dictionary of sorted words in a language you've never seen before. Write a program that returns the correct order of letters in this language.

For example, given `['xww', 'wxyz', 'wxyw', 'ywx', 'ywz']`, you should return `['x', 'z', 'w', 'y']`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1202 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

There are `N` couples sitting in a row of length `2 * N`. They are currently ordered randomly, but would like to rearrange themselves so that each couple's partners can sit side by side.

What is the minimum number of swaps necessary for this to happen?

This problem was asked by Yahoo.

Write an algorithm that computes the reversal of a directed graph. For example, if a graph consists of `A` -> `B` -> `C`, it should become `A <- B <- C`.
