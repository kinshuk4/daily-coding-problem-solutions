This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

Determine whether a tree is a valid binary search tree.

A binary search tree is a tree with two children, `left` and `right`, and satisfies the constraint that the key in the `left` child must be less than or equal to the root and the key in the `right` child must be greater than or equal to the root.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a sorted array, find the smallest positive integer that is not the sum of a subset of the array.

For example, for the input `[1, 2, 3, 10]`, you should return `7`.

Do this in `O(N)` time.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1003 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix `M`, where `M[i][j] == 1` if there is a path between vertices `i` and `j`, and otherwise `0`.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

```
graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
```

The transitive closure of this graph would be:

```
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Given a graph, find its transitive closure.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1004 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Goldman Sachs.

Given a list of numbers `L`, implement a method `sum(i, j)` which returns the sum from the sublist `L[i:j]` (including `i`, excluding `j`).

For example, given `L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `sum(1, 3)` should return `sum([2, 3])`, which is `5`.

You can assume that you can do some pre-processing. `sum()` should be optimized over the pre-processing step.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1005 [Hard]

This problem was asked by MIT.

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a two player card game whose rules are as follows:

- The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
- The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed `21`.
- The dealer must then hit if their total is `16` or lower, otherwise pass.
- Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding `21` is the winner.

For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between `2` and `10` counts as their face value, face cards count as `10`, and aces count as `1`.

Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses).

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1006 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Suppose you are given two lists of `n` points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1. Imagine a set of `n` line segments connecting each point pi to qi. Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1007 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Oracle.

You are presented with an `8` by `8` matrix representing the positions of pieces on a chess board. The only pieces on the board are the black king and various white pieces. Given this matrix, determine whether the king is in check.

For details on how each piece moves, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece#Moves_of_the_pieces).

For example, given the following matrix:

```
...K....
........
.B......
......P.
.......R
..N.....
........
.....Q..
```

You should return `True`, since the bishop is attacking the king diagonally.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1008 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Salesforce.

Given an array of integers, find the maximum XOR of any two elements.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1009 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Coursera.

Given a 2D board of characters and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

For example, given the following board:

```
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
```

`exists(board, "ABCCED")` returns `true`, `exists(board, "SEE")` returns `true`, `exists(board, "ABCB")` returns `false`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1010 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

The United States uses the imperial system of weights and measures, which means that there are many different, seemingly arbitrary units to measure distance. There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, 22 yards in a chain, [and so on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units#Length).

Create a data structure that can efficiently convert a certain quantity of one unit to the correct amount of any other unit. You should also allow for additional units to be added to the system.
