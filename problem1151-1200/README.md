## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1155 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:

- 10 = max(10, 5, 2)
- 7 = max(5, 2, 7)
- 8 = max(2, 7, 8)
- 8 = max(7, 8, 7)

Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.

Given a binary tree, find a minimum path sum from root to a leaf.

For example, the minimum path in this tree is [10, 5, 1, -1], which has sum 15.

```
  10
 /  \
5    5
 \     \
   2    1
       /
     -1
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1153 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions:

```
 (x,y) to
    (x+1, y),
    (x - 1, y),
    (x, y+1),
    (x, y-1),
    (x-1, y-1),
    (x+1,y+1),
    (x-1,y+1),
    (x+1,y-1)
```

You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

Example:

```
Input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
Output: 2
```

It takes 1 step to move from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)`. It takes one more step to move from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`.

Given an absolute pathname that may have `.` or `..` as part of it, return the shortest standardized path.

For example, given "/usr/bin/../bin/./scripts/../", return "/usr/bin/".

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1151 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if itâ€™s singly linked?

For example, `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1` returns `True` while `1 -> 4` returns `False`.
