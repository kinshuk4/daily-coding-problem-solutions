## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1188 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has. Two elements `A[i]` and `A[j]` form an inversion if `A[i] > A[j]` but `i < j`. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.

Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.

You may assume each element in the array is distinct.

For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1187 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given a starting state `start`, a list of transition probabilities for a Markov chain, and a number of steps `num_steps`. Run the Markov chain starting from `start` for `num_steps` and compute the number of times we visited each state.

For example, given the starting state `a`, number of steps 5000, and the following transition probabilities:

```
[
  ('a', 'a', 0.9),
  ('a', 'b', 0.075),
  ('a', 'c', 0.025),
  ('b', 'a', 0.15),
  ('b', 'b', 0.8),
  ('b', 'c', 0.05),
  ('c', 'a', 0.25),
  ('c', 'b', 0.25),
  ('c', 'c', 0.5)
]
```

One instance of running this Markov chain might produce `{ 'a': 3012, 'b': 1656, 'c': 332 }`.

Suppose you are given two lists of `n` points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1. Imagine a set of `n` line segments connecting each point pi to qi. Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1185 [Hard]

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1184 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You have access to ranked lists of songs for various users. Each song is represented as an integer, and more preferred songs appear earlier in each list. For example, the list `[4, 1, 7]` indicates that a user likes song `4` the best, followed by songs `1` and `7`.

Given a set of these ranked lists, interleave them to create a playlist that satisfies everyone's priorities.

For example, suppose your input is `{[1, 7, 3], [2, 1, 6, 7, 9], [3, 9, 5]}`. In this case a satisfactory playlist could be `[2, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5]`.

This problem was asked by Etsy.

Given an array of numbers `N` and an integer `k`, your task is to split `N` into `k` partitions such that the maximum sum of any partition is minimized. Return this sum.

For example, given `N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4]` and `k = 3`, you should return `8`, since the optimal partition is `[5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4]`.

A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer:

- if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2
- if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1

It is conjectured that every such sequence eventually reaches the number `1`. Test this conjecture.

Bonus: What input `n <= 1000000` gives the longest sequence?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1173 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Netflix.

A Cartesian tree with sequence `S` is a binary tree defined by the following two properties:

- It is heap-ordered, so that each parent value is strictly less than that of its children.
- An in-order traversal of the tree produces nodes with values that correspond exactly to `S`.

For example, given the sequence `[3, 2, 6, 1, 9]`, the resulting Cartesian tree would be:

```
      1
    /   \   
  2       9
 / \
3   6
```

Given a sequence `S`, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.

Design a system to crawl and copy all of Wikipedia using a distributed network of machines.

More specifically, suppose your server has access to a set of client machines. Your client machines can execute code you have written to access Wikipedia pages, download and parse their data, and write the results to a database.

Some questions you may want to consider as part of your solution are:

- How will you reach as many pages as possible?
- How can you keep track of pages that have already been visited?
- How will you deal with your client machines being blacklisted?
- How can you update your database when Wikipedia pages are added or updated?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1163 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as `[0, 1]` and `[1, 2]`, but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals `(7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8)`, return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1162 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Adobe.

You are given a tree with an even number of nodes. Consider each connection between a parent and child node to be an "edge". You would like to remove some of these edges, such that the disconnected subtrees that remain each have an even number of nodes.

For example, suppose your input was the following tree:

```
   1
  / \ 
 2   3
    / \ 
   4   5
 / | \
6  7  8
```

In this case, removing the edge (3, 4) satisfies our requirement.

Write a function that returns the *maximum* number of edges you can remove while still satisfying this requirement.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1157 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:

A researcher has index `h` if at least `h` of her `N` papers have `h` citations each. If there are multiple `h` satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.

For example, suppose `N` = 5, and the respective citations of each paper are `[4, 3, 0, 1, 5]`. Then the h-index would be `3`, since the researcher has `3` papers with at least `3` citations.

Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1155 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array, compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7, 8, 8], since:

- 10 = max(10, 5, 2)
- 7 = max(5, 2, 7)
- 8 = max(2, 7, 8)
- 8 = max(7, 8, 7)

Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you compute them.
