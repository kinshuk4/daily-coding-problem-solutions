This problem was asked by Google.

Design a system to crawl and copy all of Wikipedia using a distributed network of machines.

More specifically, suppose your server has access to a set of client machines. Your client machines can execute code you have written to access Wikipedia pages, download and parse their data, and write the results to a database.

Some questions you may want to consider as part of your solution are:

- How will you reach as many pages as possible?
- How can you keep track of pages that have already been visited?
- How will you deal with your client machines being blacklisted?
- How can you update your database when Wikipedia pages are added or updated?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #902 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as `[0, 1]` and `[1, 2]`, but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals `(7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8)`, return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #903 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given an array of numbers and a number `k`, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number `k`. For example, given `[20, 303, 3, 4, 25]` and `k = 49`, return `true` as `20 + 4 + 25 = 49`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #904 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root of a binary tree, return a deepest node. For example, in the following tree, return d.

```
    a
   / \
  b   c
 /
d
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #905 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle. A word `X` can be placed in front of another word `Y` in a circle if the last character of `X` is same as the first character of `Y`.

For example, the words `['chair', 'height', 'racket', touch', 'tunic']` can form the following circle: `chair --> racket --> touch --> height --> tunic --> chair`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #906 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of points (x, y) on a 2D cartesian plane, find the two closest points. For example, given the points `[(1, 1), (-1, -1), (3, 4), (6, 1), (-1, -6), (-4, -3)]`, return `[(-1, -1), (1, 1)]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #907 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Apple.

[Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) is a binary code where each successive value differ in only one bit, as well as when wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary spurious values during transitions.

Given a number of bits `n`, generate a possible gray code for it.

For example, for n = `2`, one gray code would be `[00, 01, 11, 10]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #908 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

```
cba
daf
ghi
```

This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:

```
ca
df
gi
```

So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

```
abcdef
```

Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

As another example, given the following table:

```
zyx
wvu
tsr
```

Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #909 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals `[0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9]`, one set of numbers that covers all these intervals is `{3, 6}`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #910 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Yelp.

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given `[6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]`, you should return `2`, as the optimal solution involves jumping from `6` to `5`, and then from `5` to `9`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #911 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #912 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Yext.

Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram `4` and `6` are cousins.

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6
```

Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.
