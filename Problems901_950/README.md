This problem was asked by Google.

Design a system to crawl and copy all of Wikipedia using a distributed network of machines.

More specifically, suppose your server has access to a set of client machines. Your client machines can execute code you have written to access Wikipedia pages, download and parse their data, and write the results to a database.

Some questions you may want to consider as part of your solution are:

- How will you reach as many pages as possible?
- How can you keep track of pages that have already been visited?
- How will you deal with your client machines being blacklisted?
- How can you update your database when Wikipedia pages are added or updated?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #902 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as `[0, 1]` and `[1, 2]`, but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals `(7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8)`, return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.
