This problem was asked by Google.

Design a system to crawl and copy all of Wikipedia using a distributed network of machines.

More specifically, suppose your server has access to a set of client machines. Your client machines can execute code you have written to access Wikipedia pages, download and parse their data, and write the results to a database.

Some questions you may want to consider as part of your solution are:

- How will you reach as many pages as possible?
- How can you keep track of pages that have already been visited?
- How will you deal with your client machines being blacklisted?
- How can you update your database when Wikipedia pages are added or updated?

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as `[0, 1]` and `[1, 2]`, but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals `(7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8)`, return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.

Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle. A word `X` can be placed in front of another word `Y` in a circle if the last character of `X` is same as the first character of `Y`.

For example, the words `['chair', 'height', 'racket', touch', 'tunic']` can form the following circle: `chair --> racket --> touch --> height --> tunic --> chair`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #906 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of points (x, y) on a 2D cartesian plane, find the two closest points. For example, given the points `[(1, 1), (-1, -1), (3, 4), (6, 1), (-1, -6), (-4, -3)]`, return `[(-1, -1), (1, 1)]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #907 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Apple.

[Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) is a binary code where each successive value differ in only one bit, as well as when wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary spurious values during transitions.

Given a number of bits `n`, generate a possible gray code for it.

For example, for n = `2`, one gray code would be `[00, 01, 11, 10]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #908 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

```
cba
daf
ghi
```

This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:

```
ca
df
gi
```

So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

```
abcdef
```

Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

As another example, given the following table:

```
zyx
wvu
tsr
```

Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #909 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals `[0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9]`, one set of numbers that covers all these intervals is `{3, 6}`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #910 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Yelp.

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given `[6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]`, you should return `2`, as the optimal solution involves jumping from `6` to `5`, and then from `5` to `9`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #912 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Yext.

Two nodes in a binary tree can be called cousins if they are on the same level of the tree but have different parents. For example, in the following diagram `4` and `6` are cousins.

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6
```

Given a binary tree and a particular node, find all cousins of that node.

Implement a queue using a set of fixed-length arrays.

The queue should support `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `get_size` operations.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #915 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

You are given an array `X` of floating-point numbers `x``1`, `x``2`, ... `x``n`. These can be rounded up or down to create a corresponding array `Y` of integers `y``1`, `y``2`, ... `y``n`.

Write an algorithm that finds an appropriate `Y` array with the following properties:

- The rounded sums of both arrays should be equal.
- The absolute pairwise difference between elements is minimized. In other words, `|x``1``- y``1``| + |x``2``- y``2``| + ... + |x``n``- y``n``|` should be as small as possible.

For example, suppose your input is `[1.3, 2.3, 4.4]`. In this case you cannot do better than `[1, 2, 5]`, which has an absolute difference of `|1.3 - 1| + |2.3 - 2| + |4.4 - 5| = 1`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #918 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are `N` sites, and each site `i` has a certain count `C``i` of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site `S``j` is defined as :

```
score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))
```

Here, `S``x`, `S``y`, `...`, `S``z` denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to `S``j`, and `d` is a damping factor, usually set to around `0.85`, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #919 [Medium]

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

A wall consists of several rows of bricks of various integer lengths and uniform height. Your goal is to find a vertical line going from the top to the bottom of the wall that cuts through the fewest number of bricks. If the line goes through the edge between two bricks, this does not count as a cut.

For example, suppose the input is as follows, where values in each row represent the lengths of bricks in that row:

```
[[3, 5, 1, 1],
 [2, 3, 3, 2],
 [5, 5],
 [4, 4, 2],
 [1, 3, 3, 3],
 [1, 1, 6, 1, 1]]
```

The best we can we do here is to draw a line after the eighth brick, which will only require cutting through the bricks in the third and fifth row.

Given an input consisting of brick lengths for each row such as the one above, return the fewest number of bricks that must be cut to create a vertical line.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #920 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Triplebyte.

Implement a data structure which carries out the following operations without resizing the underlying array:

- `add(value)`: Add a value to the set of values.
- `check(value)`: Check whether a value is in the set.

The `check` method may return occasional false positives (in other words, incorrectly identifying an element as part of the set), but should always correctly identify a true element.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #921 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding `next` and `prev` fields, it holds a field named `both`, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an `add(element)` which adds the element to the end, and a `get(index)` which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to `get_pointer` and `dereference_pointer` functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #922 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.

Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:

- `is_locked`, which returns whether the node is locked
- `lock`, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.
- `unlock`, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.

You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like. You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #925 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Write a function to flatten a nested dictionary. Namespace the keys with a period.

For example, given the following dictionary:

```
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo": {
        "a": 5,
        "bar": {
            "baz": 8
        }
    }
}
```

it should become:

```
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo.a": 5,
    "foo.bar.baz": 8
}
```

You can assume keys do not contain dots in them, i.e. no clobbering will occur.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #926 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Apple.

Given the root of a binary tree, find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all values under a node, including the node itself.

For example, given the following tree:

2  -5
```

Return `2` as it occurs twice: once as the left leaf, and once as the sum of `2 + 5 - 5`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #927 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

Given a linked list and a positive integer `k`, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

For example, given the linked list `7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5` and `k = 2`, it should become `3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7`.

Given the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `k = 3`, it should become `3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #928 [Easy]

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #929 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Square.

A competitive runner would like to create a route that starts and ends at his house, with the condition that the route goes entirely uphill at first, and then entirely downhill.

Given a dictionary of places of the form `{location: elevation}`, and a dictionary mapping paths between some of these locations to their corresponding distances, find the length of the shortest route satisfying the condition above. Assume the runner's home is location `0`.

For example, suppose you are given the following input:

```
elevations = {0: 5, 1: 25, 2: 15, 3: 20, 4: 10}
paths = {
    (0, 1): 10,
    (0, 2): 8,
    (0, 3): 15,
    (1, 3): 12,
    (2, 4): 10,
    (3, 4): 5,
    (3, 0): 17,
    (4, 0): 10
}
```

In this case, the shortest valid path would be `0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 0`, with a distance of `28`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #938 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Citrix.

You are given a circular lock with three wheels, each of which display the numbers `0` through `9` in order. Each of these wheels rotate clockwise and counterclockwise.

In addition, the lock has a certain number of "dead ends", meaning that if you turn the wheels to one of these combinations, the lock becomes stuck in that state and cannot be opened.

Let us consider a "move" to be a rotation of a single wheel by one digit, in either direction. Given a lock initially set to `000`, a target combination, and a list of dead ends, write a function that returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state, or `None` if this is impossible.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #939 [Easy]

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #940 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

A network consists of nodes labeled `0` to `N`. You are given a list of edges `(a, b, t)`, describing the time `t` it takes for a message to be sent from node `a` to node `b`. Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a neighboring node, if possible.

Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node to receive a message that begins at node `0`.

For example, given `N = 5`, and the following edges:

```
edges = [
    (0, 1, 5),
    (0, 2, 3),
    (0, 5, 4),
    (1, 3, 8),
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 5, 10),
    (3, 4, 5)
]
```

You should return `9`, because propagating the message from `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` will take that much time.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #942 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).

For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them.
