## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #951 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #952 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.

For example, the input could be 'niesevehrtfeev', which is an anagram of 'threefiveseven'. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.

Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example above, this would be `357`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #953 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be `0` or negative.

For example, `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]` should return `13`, since we pick `2`, `6`, and `5`. `[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return `10`, since we pick `5` and `5`.

Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?
