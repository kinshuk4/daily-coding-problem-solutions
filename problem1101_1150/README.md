### Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1101 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Consider the following scenario: there are `N` mice and `N` holes placed at integer points along a line. Given this, find a method that maps mice to holes such that the largest number of steps any mouse takes is minimized.

Each move consists of moving one mouse one unit to the left or right, and only one mouse can fit inside each hole.

For example, suppose the mice are positioned at `[1, 4, 9, 15]`, and the holes are located at `[10, -5, 0, 16]`. In this case, the best pairing would require us to send the mouse at `1` to the hole at `-5`, so our function should return `6`.

This problem was asked by Walmart Labs.

There are `M` people sitting in a row of `N` seats, where `M < N`. Your task is to redistribute people such that there are no gaps between any of them, while keeping overall movement to a minimum.

For example, suppose you are faced with an input of `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, where `0` represents an empty seat and `1` represents a person. In this case, one solution would be to place the person on the right in the fourth seat. We can consider the cost of a solution to be the sum of the absolute distance each person must move, so that the cost here would be five.

Given an input such as the one above, return the lowest possible cost of moving people to remove all gaps.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1103 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given an N by M matrix of `0`s and `1`s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. `0` represents an empty space while `1` represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
```

Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

- Right, down, down, right
- Down, right, down, right

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be `0`.

Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each valid number in the mapping is a single digit.

For example if {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} then “23” should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1105 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.

For example, given the multiset `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}`, it would return true, since we can split it up into `{15, 5, 10, 15, 10}` and `{20, 35},` which both add up to `55`.

Given the multiset `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35}`, it would return false, since we can't split it up into two subsets that add up to the same sum.

This problem was asked by Mailchimp.

You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.

For example, given the array `[3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1]`, you should return `3`, since the top floors of the buildings with heights `8`, `6`, and `1` all have an unobstructed view to the west.

Can you do this using just one forward pass through the array?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1107 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Adobe.

You are given a tree with an even number of nodes. Consider each connection between a parent and child node to be an "edge". You would like to remove some of these edges, such that the disconnected subtrees that remain each have an even number of nodes.

For example, suppose your input was the following tree:

```
   1
  / \ 
 2   3
    / \ 
   4   5
 / | \
6  7  8
```

In this case, removing the edge (3, 4) satisfies our requirement.

Write a function that returns the *maximum* number of edges you can remove while still satisfying this requirement.

Given an undirected graph, determine if it contains a cycle.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1109 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a pivot `x`, and a list `lst`, partition the list into three parts.

- The first part contains all elements in `lst` that are less than `x`
- The second part contains all elements in `lst` that are equal to `x`
- The third part contains all elements in `lst` that are larger than `x`

Ordering within a part can be arbitrary.

For example, given `x = 10` and `lst = [9, 12, 3, 5, 14, 10, 10]`, one partition may be `[9, 3, 5, 10, 10, 12, 14]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1111 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

At a popular bar, each customer has a set of favorite drinks, and will happily accept any drink among this set. For example, in the following situation, customer `0` will be satisfied with drinks `0`, `1`, `3`, or `6`.

```
preferences = {
    0: [0, 1, 3, 6],
    1: [1, 4, 7],
    2: [2, 4, 7, 5],
    3: [3, 2, 5],
    4: [5, 8]
}
```

A lazy bartender working at this bar is trying to reduce his effort by limiting the drink recipes he must memorize. Given a dictionary input such as the one above, return the fewest number of drinks he must learn in order to satisfy all customers.

For the input above, the answer would be `2`, as drinks `1` and `5` will satisfy everyone.

This problem was asked by Google.

A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues. It can be viewed as a list of elements written left to right such that three operations are possible:

- `push(x)`: add a new item `x` to the left end of the list
- `pop()`: remove and return the item on the left end of the list
- `pull()`: remove the item on the right end of the list.

Implement a quack using three stacks and `O(1)` additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or pull operation is `O(1)`.

You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions:

```
 (x,y) to
    (x+1, y),
    (x - 1, y),
    (x, y+1),
    (x, y-1),
    (x-1, y-1),
    (x+1,y+1),

It takes 1 step to move from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)`. It takes one more step to move from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1121 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Affirm.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock. You're also given a number `fee` that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell transaction.

You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make as many transactions as you like.

For example, given [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 10] and `fee = 2`, you should return 9, since you could buy the stock at 1 dollar, and sell at 8 dollars, and then buy it at 4 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars. Since we did two transactions, there is a 4 dollar fee, so we have 7 + 6 = 13 profit minus 4 dollars of fees.

Ghost is a two-person word game where players alternate appending letters to a word. The first person who spells out a word, or creates a prefix for which there is no possible continuation, loses. Here is a sample game:

- Player 1: `g`
- Player 2: `h`
- Player 1: `o`
- Player 2: `s`
- Player 1: `t` [loses]

Given a dictionary of words, determine the letters the first player should start with, such that with optimal play they cannot lose.

For example, if the dictionary is `["cat", "calf", "dog", "bear"]`, the only winning start letter would be `b`.

This problem was asked by MIT.

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a two player card game whose rules are as follows:

- The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
- The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed `21`.
- The dealer must then hit if their total is `16` or lower, otherwise pass.
- Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding `21` is the winner.

For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between `2` and `10` counts as their face value, face cards count as `10`, and aces count as `1`.

Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses).

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1136 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Yelp.

The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.

More rigorously, we can define it as follows:

- The horizontal distance of the root is 0.
- The horizontal distance of a left child is `hd(parent) - 1`.
- The horizontal distance of a right child is `hd(parent) + 1`.

For example, for the following tree, `hd(1) = -2`, and `hd(6) = 0`.

```
             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \
    1     4    6     9
   /                /
  0                8
```

The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal distance. If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance, either is acceptable.

For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9]`.

Given the root to a binary tree, return its bottom view.

Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.

Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:

- `is_locked`, which returns whether the node is locked
- `lock`, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.
- `unlock`, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.

You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like. You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.
