Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size `n`, and contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value)`: sets `key` to `value`. If there are already `n` items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.
- `get(key)`: gets the value at `key`. If no such key exists, return null.

Each operation should run in O(1) time.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple texts such that each text has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.

You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.

For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10, you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.

Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element doesn't exist in the array, return null.

For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).

You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.

Given a multiset of integers, return whether it can be partitioned into two subsets whose sums are the same.

For example, given the multiset `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35, 15, 10}`, it would return true, since we can split it up into `{15, 5, 10, 15, 10}` and `{20, 35},` which both add up to `55`.

Given the multiset `{15, 5, 20, 10, 35}`, it would return false, since we can't split it up into two subsets that add up to the same sum.

There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

- Right, then down
- Down, then right

Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.

 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],

- `set(key, value)`: sets `key` to `value`. If there are already `n` items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least frequently used item. If there is a tie, then the least recently used key should be removed.

On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal. This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can attack through pieces.

You are given N bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a M by M chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as (2, 1).

For example, given M = 5 and the list of bishops:

- (0, 0)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 2)
- (4, 0)

The board would look like this:

```
[b 0 0 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 b 0 0]
[0 0 0 0 0]
[b 0 0 0 0]
```

You should return 2, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops 3 and 4.

This problem was asked by Google.

In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.

Given a graph with `n` nodes and `m` directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return null.

The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The `i`-th character represents the uppercase letter of the `i`-th node. Each tuple in the edge list `(i, j)` means there is a directed edge from the `i`-th node to the `j`-th node. Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.

For example, the following input graph:

```
ABACA
[(0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 4)]
```

Would have maximum value 3 using the path of vertices `[0, 2, 3, 4]`, `(A, A, C, A)`.

The following input graph:

```
A
[(0, 0)]
```

Should return null, since we have an infinite loop.

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the `i`-th row and `j`-th column is `(i + 1) * (j + 1)` (if 0-indexed) or `i * j` (if 1-indexed).

Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the multiplication table looks like this:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |

| 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

| 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |

| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |

| 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |

And there are 4 12's in the table.

Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array. The subsequence does not necessarily have to be contiguous.

For example, given the array [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15], the longest increasing subsequence has length 6: it is 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.

76

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

```
cba
daf
ghi
```

This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:

```
ca
df
gi
```

So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

```
abcdef
```

Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

As another example, given the following table:

```
zyx
wvu
tsr
```

Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.

Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.

Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time.

It should contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value, time)`: sets key to value for t = time.
- `get(key, time)`: gets the key at t = time.

The map should work like this. If we set a key at a particular time, it will maintain that value forever or until it gets set at a later time. In other words, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value that was set for that key set at the most recent time.

Consider the following examples:

```python
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2
d.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null
d.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 0) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 0
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be 2
