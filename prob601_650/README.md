Problem 601 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Pinterest.

The sequence `[0, 1, ..., N]` has been jumbled, and the only clue you have for its order is an array representing whether each number is larger or smaller than the last. Given this information, reconstruct an array that is consistent with it. For example, given `[None, +, +, -, +]`, you could return `[1, 2, 3, 0, 4]`.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Suppose you are given two lists of `n` points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1. Imagine a set of `n` line segments connecting each point pi to qi. Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.

Problem 603 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You are given an string representing the initial conditions of some dominoes. Each element can take one of three values:

- `L`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the left,
- `R`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the right, or
- `.`, meaning the domino is standing still.

Determine the orientation of each tile when the dominoes stop falling. Note that if a domino receives a force from the left and right side simultaneously, it will remain upright.

For example, given the string `.L.R....L`, you should return `LL.RRRLLL`.

Given the string `..R...L.L`, you should return `..RR.LLLL`.

Problem 604 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Grammarly.

[Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) is an algorithm used to categorize phonetically, such that two names that sound alike but are spelled differently have the same representation.

Soundex maps every name to a string consisting of one letter and three numbers, like M460.

One version of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Remove consecutive consonants with the same sound (for example, change `ck -> c`).
2. Keep the first letter. The remaining steps only apply to the rest of the string.
3. Remove all vowels, including `y`, `w`, and `h`.
4. Replace all consonants with the following digits:
   - b, f, p, v → 1
   - c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2
   - d, t → 3
   - l → 4
   - m, n → 5
   - r → 6
5. If you don't have three numbers yet, append zeros until you do. Keep the first three numbers.

Using this scheme, `Jackson` and `Jaxen` both map to `J250`.

Implement Soundex.

Problem 605 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Palantir.

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:

A researcher has index `h` if at least `h` of her `N` papers have `h`citations each. If there are multiple `h` satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.

For example, suppose `N` = 5, and the respective citations of each paper are `[4, 3, 0, 1, 5]`. Then the h-index would be `3`, since the researcher has `3` papers with at least `3` citations.

Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that all squares are visited once.

Given N, write a function to return the number of knight's tours on an N by N chessboard.

Problem 607 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Walmart Labs.

There are `M` people sitting in a row of `N` seats, where `M < N`. Your task is to redistribute people such that there are no gaps between any of them, while keeping overall movement to a minimum.

For example, suppose you are faced with an input of `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, where `0` represents an empty seat and `1` represents a person. In this case, one solution would be to place the person on the right in the fourth seat. We can consider the cost of a solution to be the sum of the absolute distance each person must move, so that the cost here would be five.

Given an input such as the one above, return the lowest possible cost of moving people to remove all gaps.

Problem 608 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a `start` word, an `end` word, and a dictionary of valid words, find the shortest transformation sequence from `start` to `end` such that only one letter is changed at each step of the sequence, and each transformed word exists in the dictionary. If there is no possible transformation, return null. Each word in the dictionary have the same length as `start` and `end` and is lowercase.

For example, given `start = "dog"`, `end = "cat"`, and `dictionary = {"dot", "dop", "dat", "cat"}`, return `["dog", "dot", "dat", "cat"]`.

Given `start = "dog"`, `end = "cat"`, and `dictionary = {"dot", "tod", "dat", "dar"}`, return null as there is no possible transformation from `dog` to `cat`.

Problem 609 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a node in a binary search tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor.

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.

```
   10
  /  \
 5    30
     /  \
   22    35
```

You can assume each node has a `parent` pointer.

Problem 611 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Create a data structure that performs all the following operations in `O(1)` time:

- `plus`: Add a key with value `1`. If the key already exists, increment its value by one.
- `minus`: Decrement the value of a key. If the key's value is currently `1`, remove it.
- `get_max`: Return a key with the highest value.
- `get_min`: Return a key with the lowest value.

Problem 612 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as `[0, 1]` and `[1, 2]`, but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals `(7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8)`, return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.

Problem 613 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement a `PrefixMapSum` class with the following methods:

- `insert(key: str, value: int)`: Set a given key's value in the map. If the key already exists, overwrite the value.
- `sum(prefix: str)`: Return the sum of all values of keys that begin with a given prefix.

For example, you should be able to run the following code:

```
mapsum.insert("columnar", 3)
assert mapsum.sum("col") == 3

mapsum.insert("column", 2)
assert mapsum.sum("col") == 5
```

Problem 614 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Twitter.

A network consists of nodes labeled `0` to `N`. You are given a list of edges `(a, b, t)`, describing the time `t` it takes for a message to be sent from node `a` to node `b`. Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a neighboring node, if possible.

Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node to receive a message that begins at node `0`.

For example, given `N = 5`, and the following edges:

```
edges = [
    (0, 1, 5),
    (0, 2, 3),
    (0, 5, 4),
    (1, 3, 8),
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 5, 10),
    (3, 4, 5)
]
```

You should return `9`, because propagating the message from `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` will take that much time.

Problem 616 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

The [stable marriage problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) is defined as follows:

Suppose you have `N` men and `N` women, and each person has ranked their prospective opposite-sex partners in order of preference.

For example, if `N = 3`, the input could be something like this:

```
guy_preferences = {
    'andrew': ['caroline', 'abigail', 'betty'],
    'bill': ['caroline', 'betty', 'abigail'],
    'chester': ['betty', 'caroline', 'abigail'],
}

gal_preferences = {
    'abigail': ['andrew', 'bill', 'chester'],
    'betty': ['bill', 'andrew', 'chester'],
    'caroline': ['bill', 'chester', 'andrew']
}
```

Write an algorithm that pairs the men and women together in such a way that no two people of opposite sex would both rather be with each other than with their current partners.

Given a number in [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) format, convert it to decimal.

The values of Roman numerals are as follows:

```
{
    'M': 1000,
    'D': 500,
    'C': 100,
    'L': 50,
    'X': 10,
    'V': 5,
    'I': 1
}
```

In addition, note that the Roman numeral system uses [subtractive notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation) for numbers such as `IV` and `XL`.

For the input `XIV`, for instance, you should return `14`.

Problem 619 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Coursera.

Given a 2D board of characters and a word, find if the word exists in the grid.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

For example, given the following board:

```
[
  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
]
```

`exists(board, "ABCCED")` returns `true`, `exists(board, "SEE")` returns `true`, `exists(board, "ABCB")` returns `false`.

Problem 620 (Medium)

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

A wall consists of several rows of bricks of various integer lengths and uniform height. Your goal is to find a vertical line going from the top to the bottom of the wall that cuts through the fewest number of bricks. If the line goes through the edge between two bricks, this does not count as a cut.

For example, suppose the input is as follows, where values in each row represent the lengths of bricks in that row:

```
[[3, 5, 1, 1],
 [2, 3, 3, 2],
 [5, 5],
 [4, 4, 2],
 [1, 3, 3, 3],
 [1, 1, 6, 1, 1]]
```

The best we can we do here is to draw a line after the eighth brick, which will only require cutting through the bricks in the third and fifth row.

Given an input consisting of brick lengths for each row such as the one above, return the fewest number of bricks that must be cut to create a vertical line.

Problem 621 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest path in the tree.

For example, given the following tree:

```
   a
  /|\
 b c d
    / \
   e   f
  / \
 g   h
```

and the weights: `a-b: 3, a-c: 5, a-d: 8, d-e: 2, d-f: 4, e-g: 1, e-h: 1`, the longest path would be `c -> a -> d -> f`, with a length of 17.

The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any amount of children.

Problem 623 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Write an algorithm to justify text. Given a sequence of words and an integer line length k, return a list of strings which represents each line, fully justified.

More specifically, you should have as many words as possible in each line. There should be at least one space between each word. Pad extra spaces when necessary so that each line has exactly length k. Spaces should be distributed as equally as possible, with the extra spaces, if any, distributed starting from the left.

If you can only fit one word on a line, then you should pad the right-hand side with spaces.

Each word is guaranteed not to be longer than k.

For example, given the list of words ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"] and k = 16, you should return the following:

```
["the  quick brown", # 1 extra space on the left
"fox  jumps  over", # 2 extra spaces distributed evenly
"the   lazy   dog"] # 4 extra spaces distributed evenly
```

Problem 624 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each open parenthesis is eventually closed).

For example, given the string "()())()", you should return 1. Given the string ")(", you should return 2, since we must remove all of them.

For example, given `156`, you should return `3`.

Problem 626 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.

For example, if the list is `[-10, -10, 5, 2]`, we should return `500`, since that's `-10 * -10 * 5`.

You can assume the list has at least three integers.

Problem 627 (Medium)

    def __init__(self, iterator):
        pass

    def peek(self):
        pass

    def next(self):
        pass

    def hasNext(self):

```

Problem 628 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Citrix.

You are given a circular lock with three wheels, each of which display the numbers `0` through `9` in order. Each of these wheels rotate clockwise and counterclockwise.

In addition, the lock has a certain number of "dead ends", meaning that if you turn the wheels to one of these combinations, the lock becomes stuck in that state and cannot be opened.

Let us consider a "move" to be a rotation of a single wheel by one digit, in either direction. Given a lock initially set to `000`, a target combination, and a list of dead ends, write a function that returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state, or `None` if this is impossible.

Problem 629 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Etsy.

Given an array of numbers `N` and an integer `k`, your task is to split `N` into `k` partitions such that the maximum sum of any partition is minimized. Return this sum.

For example, given `N = [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 4]` and `k = 3`, you should return `8`, since the optimal partition is `[5, 1, 2], [7], [3, 4]`.

This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function `f` and an integer `n`, and calls `f` after `n` milliseconds.

Problem 631 (Hard)

This problem was asked by VMware.

The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an array of `(left, right, height)` tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of `(x, height)` tuples, giving the locations at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and each new height.

Given an array of buildings as described above, create a function that returns the skyline.

For example, suppose the input consists of the buildings `[(0, 15, 3), (4, 11, 5), (19, 23, 4)]`. In aggregate, these buildings would create a skyline that looks like the one below.

```
     ______  
    |      |        ___
 ___|      |___    |   | 
|   |   B  |   |   | C |
| A |      | A |   |   |
|   |      |   |   |   |
------------------------
```

As a result, your function should return `[(0, 3), (4, 5), (11, 3), (15, 0), (19, 4), (23, 0)]`.

Problem 632 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Snapchat.

You are given an array of length `N`, where each element `i` represents the number of ways we can produce `i` units of change. For example, `[1, 0, 1, 1, 2]` would indicate that there is only one way to make `0`, `2`, or `3` units, and two ways of making `4` units.

Given such an array, determine the denominations that must be in use. In the case above, for example, there must be coins with value `2`, `3`, and `4`.

Problem 633 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Palantir.

You are given a list of `N` numbers, in which each number is located at most `k` places away from its sorted position. For example, if `k = 1`, a given element at index `4` might end up at indices `3`, `4`, or `5`.

Come up with an algorithm that sorts this list in `O(N log k)` time.

```
      x
      x  
  x   x
  x x x
x x x x
```

Determine the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed only from the bars of the histogram. For the diagram above, for example, this would be six, representing the `2 x 3` area at the bottom right.

Problem 635 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:

- `.` (period) which matches any single character
- `*` (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element

That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid regular expression and returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression.

For example, given the regular expression "ra." and the string "ray", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "raymond" should return false.

Given the regular expression ".*at" and the string "chat", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "chats" should return false.
