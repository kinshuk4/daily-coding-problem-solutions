Problem 601 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Pinterest.

The sequence `[0, 1, ..., N]` has been jumbled, and the only clue you have for its order is an array representing whether each number is larger or smaller than the last. Given this information, reconstruct an array that is consistent with it. For example, given `[None, +, +, -, +]`, you could return `[1, 2, 3, 0, 4]`.

Problem 602 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Suppose you are given two lists of `n` points, one list p1, p2, ..., pn on the line y = 0 and the other list q1, q2, ..., qn on the line y = 1. Imagine a set of `n` line segments connecting each point pi to qi. Write an algorithm to determine how many pairs of the line segments intersect.

Problem 603 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You are given an string representing the initial conditions of some dominoes. Each element can take one of three values:

- `L`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the left,
- `R`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the right, or
- `.`, meaning the domino is standing still.

Determine the orientation of each tile when the dominoes stop falling. Note that if a domino receives a force from the left and right side simultaneously, it will remain upright.

For example, given the string `.L.R....L`, you should return `LL.RRRLLL`.

Given the string `..R...L.L`, you should return `..RR.LLLL`.

Problem 604 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Grammarly.

[Soundex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) is an algorithm used to categorize phonetically, such that two names that sound alike but are spelled differently have the same representation.

Soundex maps every name to a string consisting of one letter and three numbers, like M460.

One version of the algorithm is as follows:

1. Remove consecutive consonants with the same sound (for example, change `ck -> c`).
2. Keep the first letter. The remaining steps only apply to the rest of the string.
3. Remove all vowels, including `y`, `w`, and `h`.
4. Replace all consonants with the following digits:
   - b, f, p, v → 1
   - c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z → 2
   - d, t → 3
   - l → 4
   - m, n → 5
   - r → 6
5. If you don't have three numbers yet, append zeros until you do. Keep the first three numbers.

Using this scheme, `Jackson` and `Jaxen` both map to `J250`.

Implement Soundex.

Problem 605 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Palantir.

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:

A researcher has index `h` if at least `h` of her `N` papers have `h`citations each. If there are multiple `h` satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.

For example, suppose `N` = 5, and the respective citations of each paper are `[4, 3, 0, 1, 5]`. Then the h-index would be `3`, since the researcher has `3` papers with at least `3` citations.

Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves by a knight on a chessboard such that all squares are visited once.

Given N, write a function to return the number of knight's tours on an N by N chessboard.

Problem 607 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Walmart Labs.

There are `M` people sitting in a row of `N` seats, where `M < N`. Your task is to redistribute people such that there are no gaps between any of them, while keeping overall movement to a minimum.

For example, suppose you are faced with an input of `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, where `0` represents an empty seat and `1` represents a person. In this case, one solution would be to place the person on the right in the fourth seat. We can consider the cost of a solution to be the sum of the absolute distance each person must move, so that the cost here would be five.

Given an input such as the one above, return the lowest possible cost of moving people to remove all gaps.

Problem 608 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a `start` word, an `end` word, and a dictionary of valid words, find the shortest transformation sequence from `start` to `end` such that only one letter is changed at each step of the sequence, and each transformed word exists in the dictionary. If there is no possible transformation, return null. Each word in the dictionary have the same length as `start` and `end` and is lowercase.

For example, given `start = "dog"`, `end = "cat"`, and `dictionary = {"dot", "dop", "dat", "cat"}`, return `["dog", "dot", "dat", "cat"]`.

Given `start = "dog"`, `end = "cat"`, and `dictionary = {"dot", "tod", "dat", "dar"}`, return null as there is no possible transformation from `dog` to `cat`.

Problem 609 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a node in a binary search tree, return the next bigger element, also known as the inorder successor.

For example, the inorder successor of 22 is 30.

```
   10
  /  \
 5    30
     /  \
   22    35
```

You can assume each node has a `parent` pointer.

Implement division of two positive integers without using the division, multiplication, or modulus operators. Return the quotient as an integer, ignoring the remainder.

Problem 611 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Create a data structure that performs all the following operations in `O(1)` time:

- `plus`: Add a key with value `1`. If the key already exists, increment its value by one.
- `minus`: Decrement the value of a key. If the key's value is currently `1`, remove it.
- `get_max`: Return a key with the highest value.
- `get_min`: Return a key with the lowest value.

Problem 612 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Intervals can "touch", such as `[0, 1]` and `[1, 2]`, but they won't be considered overlapping.

For example, given the intervals `(7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8)`, return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap.

The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.

Problem 613 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Google.

Implement a `PrefixMapSum` class with the following methods:

- `insert(key: str, value: int)`: Set a given key's value in the map. If the key already exists, overwrite the value.
- `sum(prefix: str)`: Return the sum of all values of keys that begin with a given prefix.

For example, you should be able to run the following code:

```
mapsum.insert("columnar", 3)
assert mapsum.sum("col") == 3

mapsum.insert("column", 2)
assert mapsum.sum("col") == 5
```

Problem 614 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Twitter.

A network consists of nodes labeled `0` to `N`. You are given a list of edges `(a, b, t)`, describing the time `t` it takes for a message to be sent from node `a` to node `b`. Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a neighboring node, if possible.

Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node to receive a message that begins at node `0`.

For example, given `N = 5`, and the following edges:

```
edges = [
    (0, 1, 5),
    (0, 2, 3),
    (0, 5, 4),
    (1, 3, 8),
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 5, 10),
    (3, 4, 5)
]
```

You should return `9`, because propagating the message from `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` will take that much time.

Problem 616 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

The [stable marriage problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) is defined as follows:

Suppose you have `N` men and `N` women, and each person has ranked their prospective opposite-sex partners in order of preference.

For example, if `N = 3`, the input could be something like this:

```
guy_preferences = {
    'andrew': ['caroline', 'abigail', 'betty'],
    'bill': ['caroline', 'betty', 'abigail'],
    'chester': ['betty', 'caroline', 'abigail'],
}

gal_preferences = {
    'abigail': ['andrew', 'bill', 'chester'],
    'betty': ['bill', 'andrew', 'chester'],
    'caroline': ['bill', 'chester', 'andrew']
}
```

Write an algorithm that pairs the men and women together in such a way that no two people of opposite sex would both rather be with each other than with their current partners.

Problem 616 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

A cryptarithmetic puzzle is a mathematical game where the digits of some numbers are represented by letters. Each letter represents a unique digit.

For example, a puzzle of the form:

```
  SEND
+ MORE
--------
 MONEY
```

may have the solution:

```
{'S': 9, 'E': 5, 'N': 6, 'D': 7, 'M': 1, 'O', 0, 'R': 8, 'Y': 2}
```

Given a three-word puzzle like the one above, create an algorithm that finds a solution.

Problem 617 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a number in [Roman numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) format, convert it to decimal.

The values of Roman numerals are as follows:

```
{
    'M': 1000,
    'D': 500,
    'C': 100,
    'L': 50,
    'X': 10,
    'V': 5,
    'I': 1
}
```

In addition, note that the Roman numeral system uses [subtractive notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation) for numbers such as `IV` and `XL`.

For the input `XIV`, for instance, you should return `14`.
