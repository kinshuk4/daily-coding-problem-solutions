## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1618 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Zillow.

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of `7`, or the sum of unique powers of `7`. The first few sevenish numbers are `1`, `7`, `8`, `49`, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the `n`th sevenish number.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1617 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You are given an string representing the initial conditions of some dominoes. Each element can take one of three values:

- `L`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the left,
- `R`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the right, or
- `.`, meaning the domino is standing still.

Determine the orientation of each tile when the dominoes stop falling. Note that if a domino receives a force from the left and right side simultaneously, it will remain upright.

For example, given the string `.L.R....L`, you should return `LL.RRRLLL`.

Given the string `..R...L.L`, you should return `..RR.LLLL`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1616 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Alibaba.

Given an even number (greater than 2), return two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to the given number.

A solution will always exist. See [Goldbachâ€™s conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture).

Example:

```
Input: 4
Output: 2 + 2 = 4
```

If there are more than one solution possible, return the lexicographically smaller solution.

If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, then

```
[a, b] < [c, d]
```

If a < c OR a==c AND b < d.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given an array and a number `k` that's smaller than the length of the array, rotate the array to the right `k` elements in-place.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1614 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1613 [Hard]

This problem was asked by VMware.

The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an array of `(left, right, height)` tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of `(x, height)` tuples, giving the locations at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and each new height.

Given an array of buildings as described above, create a function that returns the skyline.

For example, suppose the input consists of the buildings `[(0, 15, 3), (4, 11, 5), (19, 23, 4)]`. In aggregate, these buildings would create a skyline that looks like the one below.

```
     ______  
    |      |        ___
 ___|      |___    |   | 
|   |   B  |   |   | C |
| A |      | A |   |   |
|   |      |   |   |   |
------------------------
```

As a result, your function should return `[(0, 3), (4, 5), (11, 3), (15, 0), (19, 4), (23, 0)]`.

Given a sorted array, convert it into a height-balanced binary search tree.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1611 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Yahoo.

You are given a string of length `N` and a parameter `k`. The string can be manipulated by taking one of the first `k` letters and moving it to the end.

Write a program to determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be created after an unlimited number of moves.

For example, suppose we are given the string `daily` and `k = 1`. The best we can create in this case is `ailyd`.

Given a stream of elements too large to store in memory, pick a random element from the stream with uniform probability.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1609 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

You are given an array of length `24`, where each element represents the number of new subscribers during the corresponding hour. Implement a data structure that efficiently supports the following:

- `update(hour: int, value: int)`: Increment the element at index `hour` by `value`.
- `query(start: int, end: int)`: Retrieve the number of subscribers that have signed up between `start` and `end` (inclusive).

You can assume that all values get cleared at the end of the day, and that you will not be asked for `start` and `end` values that wrap around midnight.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1608 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Write a program to determine how many distinct ways there are to create a max heap from a list of `N` given integers.

For example, if `N = 3`, and our integers are `[1, 2, 3]`, there are two ways, shown below.

```
  3      3
 / \    / \
1   2  2   1

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1607 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string `s1` to another `s2`.

For example, given `s1 = abc` and `s2 = bcd`, return `true` since we can map `a` to `b`, `b` to `c`, and `c` to `d`.

Given `s1 = foo` and `s2 = bar`, return `false` since the `o` cannot map to two characters.

You are given a `2 x N` board, and instructed to completely cover the board with the following shapes:

- Dominoes, or `2 x 1` rectangles.
- Trominoes, or `L`-shapes.

For example, if `N = 4`, here is one possible configuration, where `A` is a domino, and `B` and `C` are trominoes.

```
A B B C
A B C C
```

Given an integer `N`, determine in how many ways this task is possible.

Given a binary search tree, find the floor and ceiling of a given integer. The floor is the highest element in the tree less than or equal to an integer, while the ceiling is the lowest element in the tree greater than or equal to an integer.

If either value does not exist, return None.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1602 [Medium]

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

You are given a string consisting of the letters `x` and `y`, such as `xyxxxyxyy`. In addition, you have an operation called `flip`, which changes a single `x` to `y` or vice versa.

Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all `x`'s come before all `y`'s. In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return `2`.
