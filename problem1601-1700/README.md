## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1608 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Write a program to determine how many distinct ways there are to create a max heap from a list of `N` given integers.

For example, if `N = 3`, and our integers are `[1, 2, 3]`, there are two ways, shown below.

```
  3      3
 / \    / \
1   2  2   1
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1607 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string `s1` to another `s2`.

For example, given `s1 = abc` and `s2 = bcd`, return `true` since we can map `a` to `b`, `b` to `c`, and `c` to `d`.

Given `s1 = foo` and `s2 = bar`, return `false` since the `o` cannot map to two characters.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1606 [Easy]

This problem was asked by PayPal.

Given a binary tree, determine whether or not it is height-balanced. A height-balanced binary tree can be defined as one in which the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1605 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Wayfair.

You are given a `2 x N` board, and instructed to completely cover the board with the following shapes:

- Dominoes, or `2 x 1` rectangles.
- Trominoes, or `L`-shapes.

For example, if `N = 4`, here is one possible configuration, where `A` is a domino, and `B` and `C` are trominoes.

```
A B B C
A B C C
```

Given an integer `N`, determine in how many ways this task is possible.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1604 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Oracle.

Given a binary search tree, find the floor and ceiling of a given integer. The floor is the highest element in the tree less than or equal to an integer, while the ceiling is the lowest element in the tree greater than or equal to an integer.

If either value does not exist, return None.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1603 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Pivotal.

Write an algorithm that finds the total number of set bits in all integers between `1` and `N`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1602 [Medium]

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

You are given a string consisting of the letters `x` and `y`, such as `xyxxxyxyy`. In addition, you have an operation called `flip`, which changes a single `x` to `y` or vice versa.

Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all `x`'s come before all `y`'s. In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return `2`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1601 [Easy]

This question was asked by Apple.

Given a binary tree, find a minimum path sum from root to a leaf.

For example, the minimum path in this tree is [10, 5, 1, -1], which has sum 15.

```
  10
 /  \
5    5
 \     \
   2    1
       /
     -1
```
