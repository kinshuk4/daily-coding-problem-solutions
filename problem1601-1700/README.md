## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1604 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Oracle.

Given a binary search tree, find the floor and ceiling of a given integer. The floor is the highest element in the tree less than or equal to an integer, while the ceiling is the lowest element in the tree greater than or equal to an integer.

If either value does not exist, return None.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1602 [Medium]

This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

You are given a string consisting of the letters `x` and `y`, such as `xyxxxyxyy`. In addition, you have an operation called `flip`, which changes a single `x` to `y` or vice versa.

Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all `x`'s come before all `y`'s. In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return `2`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1601 [Easy]

This question was asked by Apple.

Given a binary tree, find a minimum path sum from root to a leaf.

For example, the minimum path in this tree is [10, 5, 1, -1], which has sum 15.

```
  10
 /  \
5    5
 \     \
   2    1
       /
     -1
```
