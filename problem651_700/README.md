Determine whether a tree is a valid binary search tree.

A binary search tree is a tree with two children, `left` and `right`, and satisfies the constraint that the key in the `left` child must be less than or equal to the root and the key in the `right` child must be greater than or equal to the root.

You are going on a road trip, and would like to create a suitable music playlist. The trip will require `N` songs, though you only have `M` songs downloaded, where `M < N`. A valid playlist should select each song at least once, and guarantee a buffer of `B` songs between repeats.

Given `N`, `M`, and `B`, determine the number of valid playlists.

## Problem #653 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given given a list of rectangles represented by min and max x- and y-coordinates. Compute whether or not a pair of rectangles overlap each other. If one rectangle completely covers another, it is considered overlapping.

For example, given the following rectangles:

```
{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
},
{
    "top_left": (-1, 3),
    "dimensions": (2, 1)
},
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3)
}
```

return `true` as the first and third rectangle overlap each other.

Given a 32-bit integer, return the number with its bits reversed.

For example, given the binary number `1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000`, return `0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111`.

## Problem #656 [Medium]

Given a 2-D matrix representing an image, a location of a pixel in the screen and a color `C`, replace the color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with `C`.

For example, given the following matrix, and location pixel of (2, 2), and 'G' for green:

```
B B W
W W W
W W W
B B B
```

Becomes

```
B B G
G G G
G G G
B B B
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #657 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set `{1, 2, 3}`, it should return `{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}`.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #658 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains an empty sub-directory `subdir1` and a sub-directory `subdir2` containing a file `file.ext`.

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains two sub-directories `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and an empty second-level sub-directory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a second-level sub-directory `subsubdir2` containing a file `file2.ext`.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`, and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:

The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.

The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.

Design and implement a HitCounter class that keeps track of requests (or hits). It should support the following operations:

- `record(timestamp)`: records a hit that happened at `timestamp`
- `total()`: returns the total number of hits recorded
- `range(lower, upper)`: returns the number of hits that occurred between timestamps `lower` and `upper` (inclusive)

Follow-up: What if our system has limited memory?

Given an array of positive integers, divide the array into two subsets such that the difference between the sum of the subsets is as small as possible.

For example, given `[5, 10, 15, 20, 25]`, return the sets `{10, 25}` and `{5, 15, 20}`, which has a difference of 5, which is the smallest possible difference.

In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on game results.

A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a 2000-ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player.

Implement this system.

This problem was asked by Google.

The game of Nim is played as follows. Starting with three heaps, each containing a variable number of items, two players take turns removing one or more items from a single pile. The player who eventually is forced to take the last stone loses. For example, if the initial heap sizes are `3`, `4`, and `5`, a game could be played as shown below:

```
  A  |  B  |  C
-----------------
  3  |  4  |  5
  3  |  1  |  3
  3  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  0
  0  |  0  |  0 
```

In other words, to start, the first player takes three items from pile `B`. The second player responds by removing two stones from pile `C`. The game continues in this way until player one takes last stone and loses.

Given a list of non-zero starting values `[a, b, c]`, and assuming optimal play, determine whether the first player has a forced win.

For example, given `n` = 13, return 2 since 13 = 32 + 22 = 9 + 4.

Given `n` = 27, return 3 since 27 = 32 + 32 + 32 = 9 + 9 + 9.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #672 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle of numbers. For example, `[[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]]` represents the triangle:

```
  1
 2 3
1 5 1
```

We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.

A girl is walking along an apple orchard with a bag in each hand. She likes to pick apples from each tree as she goes along, but is meticulous about not putting different kinds of apples in the same bag.

Given an input describing the types of apples she will pass on her path, in order, determine the length of the longest portion of her path that consists of just two types of apple trees.

For example, given the input `[2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 5]`, the longest portion will involve types `1` and `3`, with a length of four.

You are given a set of synonyms, such as `(big, large)` and `(eat, consume)`. Using this set, determine if two sentences with the same number of words are equivalent.

For example, the following two sentences are equivalent:

- "He wants to eat food."
- "He wants to consume food."

Note that the synonyms `(a, b)` and `(a, c)` do not necessarily imply `(b, c)`: consider the case of `(coach, bus)` and `(coach, teacher)`.

Follow-up: what if we can assume that `(a, b)` and `(a, c)` do in fact imply `(b, c)`?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #677 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Square.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than `N`. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.

For example, to find all primes less than `100`, we would first mark `[4, 6, 8, ...]` (multiples of two), then `[6, 9, 12, ...]` (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than `N`, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.

Implement this algorithm.

Bonus: Create a generator that produces primes indefinitely (that is, without taking `N` as an input).
