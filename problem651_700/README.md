You are going on a road trip, and would like to create a suitable music playlist. The trip will require `N` songs, though you only have `M` songs downloaded, where `M < N`. A valid playlist should select each song at least once, and guarantee a buffer of `B` songs between repeats.

Given `N`, `M`, and `B`, determine the number of valid playlists.

## Problem #653 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given given a list of rectangles represented by min and max x- and y-coordinates. Compute whether or not a pair of rectangles overlap each other. If one rectangle completely covers another, it is considered overlapping.

For example, given the following rectangles:

```
{
    "top_left": (1, 4),
    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
},
{
    "top_left": (-1, 3),
    "dimensions": (2, 1)
},
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3)
}
```

return `true` as the first and third rectangle overlap each other.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #657 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set `{1, 2, 3}`, it should return `{{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}`.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #658 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

Suppose we represent our file system by a string in the following manner:

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tfile.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
    subdir2
        file.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains an empty sub-directory `subdir1` and a sub-directory `subdir2` containing a file `file.ext`.

The string `"dir\n\tsubdir1\n\t\tfile1.ext\n\t\tsubsubdir1\n\tsubdir2\n\t\tsubsubdir2\n\t\t\tfile2.ext"` represents:

```
dir
    subdir1
        file1.ext
        subsubdir1
    subdir2
        subsubdir2
            file2.ext
```

The directory `dir` contains two sub-directories `subdir1` and `subdir2`. `subdir1` contains a file `file1.ext` and an empty second-level sub-directory `subsubdir1`. `subdir2` contains a second-level sub-directory `subsubdir2` containing a file `file2.ext`.

We are interested in finding the longest (number of characters) absolute path to a file within our file system. For example, in the second example above, the longest absolute path is `"dir/subdir2/subsubdir2/file2.ext"`, and its length is 32 (not including the double quotes).

Given a string representing the file system in the above format, return the length of the longest absolute path to a file in the abstracted file system. If there is no file in the system, return 0.

Note:

The name of a file contains at least a period and an extension.

The name of a directory or sub-directory will not contain a period.

In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on game results.

A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a 2000-ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player.

Implement this system.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #669 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

The game of Nim is played as follows. Starting with three heaps, each containing a variable number of items, two players take turns removing one or more items from a single pile. The player who eventually is forced to take the last stone loses. For example, if the initial heap sizes are `3`, `4`, and `5`, a game could be played as shown below:

```
  A  |  B  |  C
-----------------
  3  |  4  |  5
  3  |  1  |  3
  3  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  0
  0  |  0  |  0 
```

In other words, to start, the first player takes three items from pile `B`. The second player responds by removing two stones from pile `C`. The game continues in this way until player one takes last stone and loses.

Given a list of non-zero starting values `[a, b, c]`, and assuming optimal play, determine whether the first player has a forced win.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #672 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle of numbers. For example, `[[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]]` represents the triangle:

```
  1
 2 3
1 5 1
```

We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #677 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Square.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than `N`. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.

For example, to find all primes less than `100`, we would first mark `[4, 6, 8, ...]` (multiples of two), then `[6, 9, 12, ...]` (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than `N`, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.

Implement this algorithm.

Bonus: Create a generator that produces primes indefinitely (that is, without taking `N` as an input).

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #679 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has. Two elements `A[i]` and `A[j]` form an inversion if `A[i] > A[j]` but `i < j`. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.

Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.

You may assume each element in the array is distinct.

For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.

[Snakes and Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders) is a game played on a `10 x 10` board, the goal of which is get from square `1` to square `100`. On each turn players will roll a six-sided die and move forward a number of spaces equal to the result. If they land on a square that represents a snake or ladder, they will be transported ahead or behind, respectively, to a new square.

Find the smallest number of turns it takes to play snakes and ladders.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #684 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

`reduce` (also known as `fold`) is a function that takes in an array, a combining function, and an initial value and builds up a result by calling the combining function on each element of the array, left to right. For example, we can write `sum()` in terms of `reduce`:

```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def sum(lst):
    return reduce(lst, add, 0)
```

This should call `add` on the initial value with the first element of the array, and then the result of that with the second element of the array, and so on until we reach the end, when we return the sum of the array.

Implement your own version of `reduce`.

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

A Boolean formula can be said to be satisfiable if there is a way to assign truth values to each variable such that the entire formula evaluates to true.

For example, suppose we have the following formula, where the symbol `¬` is used to denote negation:

```
(¬c OR b) AND (b OR c) AND (¬b OR c) AND (¬c OR ¬a)
```

One way to satisfy this formula would be to let `a = False`, `b = True`, and `c = True`.

This type of formula, with `AND` statements joining tuples containing exactly one `OR`, is known as `2-CNF`.

Given a `2-CNF` formula, find a way to assign truth values to satisfy it, or return `False` if this is impossible.

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

You are given a huge list of airline ticket prices between different cities around the world on a given day. These are all direct flights. Each element in the list has the format `(source_city, destination, price)`.

Consider a user who is willing to take up to `k` connections from their origin city `A` to their destination `B`. Find the cheapest fare possible for this journey and print the itinerary for that journey.

For example, our traveler wants to go from `JFK` to `LAX` with up to `3` connections, and our input flights are as follows:

```
[
    ('JFK', 'ATL', 150),
    ('ATL', 'SFO', 400),
    ('ORD', 'LAX', 200),

    ('JFK', 'HKG', 800),
    ('ATL', 'ORD', 90),
    ('JFK', 'LAX', 500),
]
```

Due to some improbably low flight prices, the cheapest itinerary would be `JFK -> ATL -> ORD -> LAX`, costing $440.
