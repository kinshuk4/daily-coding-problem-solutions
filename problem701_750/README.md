## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #701 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

At a popular bar, each customer has a set of favorite drinks, and will happily accept any drink among this set. For example, in the following situation, customer `0` will be satisfied with drinks `0`, `1`, `3`, or `6`.

```
preferences = {
    0: [0, 1, 3, 6],
    1: [1, 4, 7],
    2: [2, 4, 7, 5],
    3: [3, 2, 5],
    4: [5, 8]
}
```

A lazy bartender working at this bar is trying to reduce his effort by limiting the drink recipes he must memorize. Given a dictionary input such as the one above, return the fewest number of drinks he must learn in order to satisfy all customers.

For the input above, the answer would be `2`, as drinks `1` and `5` will satisfy everyone.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #702 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Google.

Given the root to a binary tree, implement `serialize(root)`, which serializes the tree into a string, and `deserialize(s)`, which deserializes the string back into the tree.

For example, given the following `Node` class

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

The following test should pass:

```
node = Node('root', Node('left', Node('left.left')), Node('right'))
assert deserialize(serialize(node)).left.left.val == 'left.left'
```

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

A knight is placed on a given square on an `8 x 8` chessboard. It is then moved randomly several times, where each move is a standard [knight move](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)#Movement). If the knight jumps off the board at any point, however, it is not allowed to jump back on.

After `k` moves, what is the probability that the knight remains on the board?

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #704 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Uber.

One way to unlock an Android phone is through a pattern of swipes across a `1-9` keypad.

For a pattern to be valid, it must satisfy the following:

- All of its keys must be distinct.
- It must not connect two keys by jumping over a third key, unless that key has already been used.

For example, `4 - 2 - 1 - 7` is a valid pattern, whereas `2 - 1 - 7` is not.

Find the total number of valid unlock patterns of length `N`, where `1 <= N <= 9`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #705 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height. Suppose it will rain and all spots between two walls get filled up.

Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1) space.

For example, given the input [2, 1, 2], we can hold 1 unit of water in the middle.

Given the input [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5], we can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off to the left), so we can trap 8 units of water.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #706 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

The `24` game is played as follows. You are given a list of four integers, each between `1` and `9`, in a fixed order. By placing the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` between the numbers, and grouping them with parentheses, determine whether it is possible to reach the value `24`.

For example, given the input `[5, 2, 7, 8]`, you should return `True`, since `(5 * 2 - 7) * 8 = 24`.

Write a function that plays the `24` game.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #707 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You are the technical director of WSPT radio, serving listeners nationwide. For simplicity's sake we can consider each listener to live along a horizontal line stretching from `0` (west) to `1000` (east).

Given a list of `N` listeners, and a list of `M` radio towers, each placed at various locations along this line, determine what the minimum broadcast range would have to be in order for each listener's home to be covered.

For example, suppose `listeners = [1, 5, 11, 20]`, and `towers = [4, 8, 15]`. In this case the minimum range would be `5`, since that would be required for the tower at position `15` to reach the listener at position `20`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #708 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Apple.

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index. Given a sorted array of distinct elements, return a fixed point, if one exists. Otherwise, return `False`.

For example, given `[-6, 0, 2, 40]`, you should return `2`. Given `[1, 5, 7, 8]`, you should return `False`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #709 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given an N by M matrix of `0`s and `1`s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. `0` represents an empty space while `1` represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
```

Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

- Right, down, down, right
- Down, right, down, right

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be `0`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #710 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a string `s` and a list of words `words`, where each word is the same length, find all starting indices of substrings in `s` that is a concatenation of every word in `words` exactly once.

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], return [0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in `s`.

The order of the indices does not matter.

Determine whether a doubly linked list is a palindrome. What if it’s singly linked?

For example, `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1` returns `True` while `1 -> 4` returns `False`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #716 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Google.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, €, corresponds to the three bytes `11100010 10000010 10101100`. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

- For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
- For an `n`-byte character, the first byte starts with `n` ones and a zero. The other `n - 1` bytes all start with `10`.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

Write a program that takes in an array of integers representing byte values, and returns whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #718 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Apple.

[Gray code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code) is a binary code where each successive value differ in only one bit, as well as when wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware so that we don't see temporary spurious values during transitions.

Given a number of bits `n`, generate a possible gray code for it.

For example, for n = `2`, one gray code would be `[00, 01, 11, 10]`.

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.

Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

```
    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
```

You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #725 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Consider the following scenario: there are `N` mice and `N` holes placed at integer points along a line. Given this, find a method that maps mice to holes such that the largest number of steps any mouse takes is minimized.

Each move consists of moving one mouse one unit to the left or right, and only one mouse can fit inside each hole.

For example, suppose the mice are positioned at `[1, 4, 9, 15]`, and the holes are located at `[10, -5, 0, 16]`. In this case, the best pairing would require us to send the mouse at `1` to the hole at `-5`, so our function should return `6`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #728 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Twitter.

A teacher must divide a class of students into two teams to play dodgeball. Unfortunately, not all the kids get along, and several refuse to be put on the same team as that of their enemies.

Given an adjacency list of students and their enemies, write an algorithm that finds a satisfactory pair of teams, or returns `False` if none exists.

For example, given the following enemy graph you should return the teams `{0, 1, 4, 5}` and `{2, 3}`.

```
students = {
    0: [3],
    1: [2],
    2: [1, 4],
    3: [0, 4, 5],
    4: [2, 3],
    5: [3]
}
```

On the other hand, given the input below, you should return `False`.

```
students = {
    0: [3],
    1: [2],
    2: [1, 3, 4],
    3: [0, 2, 4, 5],
    4: [2, 3],
    5: [3]
}

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #729 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You have access to ranked lists of songs for various users. Each song is represented as an integer, and more preferred songs appear earlier in each list. For example, the list `[4, 1, 7]` indicates that a user likes song `4` the best, followed by songs `1` and `7`.

Given a set of these ranked lists, interleave them to create a playlist that satisfies everyone's priorities.

For example, suppose your input is `{[1, 7, 3], [2, 1, 6, 7, 9], [3, 9, 5]}`. In this case a satisfactory playlist could be `[2, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5]`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #734 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Write a map implementation with a get function that lets you retrieve the value of a key at a particular time.

It should contain the following methods:

- `set(key, value, time)`: sets key to value for t = time.
- `get(key, time)`: gets the key at t = time.

The map should work like this. If we set a key at a particular time, it will maintain that value forever or until it gets set at a later time. In other words, when we get a key at a time, it should return the value that was set for that key set at the most recent time.

Consider the following examples:

```
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 2) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 2
d.get(1, 1) # get key 1 at time 1 should be 1
d.get(1, 3) # get key 1 at time 3 should be 2
d.set(1, 1, 5) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 5
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be null
d.get(1, 10) # get key 1 at time 10 should be 1
d.set(1, 1, 0) # set key 1 to value 1 at time 0
d.set(1, 2, 0) # set key 1 to value 2 at time 0
d.get(1, 0) # get key 1 at time 0 should be 2
```

We're given a hashmap associating each `courseId` key with a list of `courseIds` values, which represents that the prerequisites of `courseId` are `courseIds`. Return a sorted ordering of courses such that we can finish all courses.

Return null if there is no such ordering.

For example, given {'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 'CSC200': ['CSC100'], 'CSC100': []}, should return ['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSCS300'].

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #738 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple lines such that each line has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words. If there's no way to break the text up, then return null.

You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there is exactly one space between each word.

For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10, you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]. No string in the list has a length of more than 10.

This problem was asked by Google.

A quack is a data structure combining properties of both stacks and queues. It can be viewed as a list of elements written left to right such that three operations are possible:

- `push(x)`: add a new item `x` to the left end of the list
- `pop()`: remove and return the item on the left end of the list
- `pull()`: remove the item on the right end of the list.

Implement a quack using three stacks and `O(1)` additional memory, so that the amortized time for any push, pop, or pull operation is `O(1)`.
