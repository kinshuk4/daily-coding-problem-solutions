## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #751 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has `O(h)` space complexity, where `h` is the height of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using `O(1)` space.

Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise. For example, the following should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

```
  1
 / \
2   3
   / \
  4   5
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #753 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Zillow.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up to three children. Here is an example which represents the words `code`, `cob`, `be`, `ax`, `war`, and `we`.

```
       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \ 
x   b  e   r  e  
```

The tree is structured according to the following rules:

- left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent prefix
- right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent prefix
- middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since `code` is the first word inserted in the tree, and `cob` lexicographically precedes `cod`, `cob` is represented as a left child extending from `cod`.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #754 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Square.

In front of you is a row of `N` coins, with values `v``1`, `v``1`, ..., `v``n`.

You are asked to play the following game. You and an opponent take turns choosing either the first or last coin from the row, removing it from the row, and receiving the value of the coin.

Write a program that returns the maximum amount of money you can win with certainty, if you move first, assuming your opponent plays optimally.
