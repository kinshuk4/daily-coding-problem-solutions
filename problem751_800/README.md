## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #751 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has `O(h)` space complexity, where `h` is the height of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using `O(1)` space.

Print the nodes in a binary tree level-wise. For example, the following should print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

```
  1
 / \
2   3
   / \
  4   5
```

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #753 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Zillow.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up to three children. Here is an example which represents the words `code`, `cob`, `be`, `ax`, `war`, and `we`.

```
       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \ 
x   b  e   r  e  
```

The tree is structured according to the following rules:

- left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent prefix
- right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent prefix
- middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since `code` is the first word inserted in the tree, and `cob` lexicographically precedes `cod`, `cob` is represented as a left child extending from `cod`.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #754 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Square.

In front of you is a row of `N` coins, with values `v``1`, `v``1`, ..., `v``n`.

You are asked to play the following game. You and an opponent take turns choosing either the first or last coin from the row, removing it from the row, and receiving the value of the coin.

Write a program that returns the maximum amount of money you can win with certainty, if you move first, assuming your opponent plays optimally.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #755 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Google.

In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.

Given a graph with `n` nodes and `m` directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return null.

The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The `i`-th character represents the uppercase letter of the `i`-th node. Each tuple in the edge list `(i, j)` means there is a directed edge from the `i`-th node to the `j`-th node. Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.

For example, the following input graph:

```
ABACA
[(0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 4)]
```

Would have maximum value 3 using the path of vertices `[0, 2, 3, 4]`, `(A, A, C, A)`.

The following input graph:

```
A
[(0, 0)]
```

Should return null, since we have an infinite loop.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #756 [Easy]

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.

For example, the input could be 'niesevehrtfeev', which is an anagram of 'threefiveseven'. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.

Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example above, this would be `357`.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #757 [Hard]

This problem was asked by MIT.

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a two player card game whose rules are as follows:

- The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
- The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed `21`.
- The dealer must then hit if their total is `16` or lower, otherwise pass.
- Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding `21` is the winner.

For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between `2` and `10` counts as their face value, face cards count as `10`, and aces count as `1`.

Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses).
