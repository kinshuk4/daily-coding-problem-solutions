## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #751 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Typically, an implementation of in-order traversal of a binary tree has `O(h)` space complexity, where `h` is the height of the tree. Write a program to compute the in-order traversal of a binary tree using `O(1)` space.
