## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1305 [Hard]

This problem was asked by YouTube.

Write a program that computes the length of the longest common subsequence of three given strings. For example, given "epidemiologist", "refrigeration", and "supercalifragilisticexpialodocious", it should return `5`, since the longest common subsequence is "eieio".

Given an integer n, find the next biggest integer with the same number of 1-bits on. For example, given the number 6 (`0110` in binary), return 9 (`1001`).

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1302 [Hard]

This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input `[3, 4, -1, 1]` should give `2`. The input `[1, 2, 0]` should give `3`.

You can modify the input array in-place.

## Daily Coding Problem: Problem #1301 [Medium]

This problem was asked by Flipkart.

Starting from 0 on a number line, you would like to make a series of jumps that lead to the integer N.

On the `i``th` jump, you may move exactly i places to the left or right.

Find a path with the fewest number of jumps required to get from 0 to N.
